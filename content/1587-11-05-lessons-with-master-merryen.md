Master Merryen of Maraisbourg was not what I expected. I found him in the Fechtschule in the Tanner's Quarter, a broad-beamed hall that smelled of sweat, chalk, and oiled wood. He was no greybeard hermit; he could not have been more than five-and-twenty. Yet when he took up a longsword his movements were like a dance I had never seen—graceful, expansive, each cut flowing into the next. He smiled when I bowed and introduced myself as Faelar the bard.

He asked me to show him what I had learned. I performed the master strikes Lychenar had drilled into me: Zornhau, Krumphau, Zwerchhau, Schielhau, Scheitelhau. Merryen nodded, corrected my footwork, and then began to teach. His developing strikes were variations I had only glimpsed in the hermit's worn Fechtbucher. He showed how to extend the Oberhau into a series of flowing cuts, how to transition from a Krumphau into a thrust that chased an opponent's retreat. Where the hermit had been stern and sparse, Merryen was exuberant, explaining the why as much as the how.

We spent hours on measure and tempo. “A good cut is a song,” he said. “It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Do not rush to the chorus.” He had me cut at hanging sandbags, then at wooden pell posts, then at a partner. He showed me how to circle and advance in the wide steps he favoured, to use the whole body as instrument. By sunset my shoulders burned, but I felt the melodies of steel in my limbs.

On the second day he introduced me to the rapier. The weapon was slender, unforgiving, and alien compared to the wooden sword I had carried. Merryen’s rapier work was all thrust and feint, built on precision and deception. “Think of it as a sharp quill,” he said, handing me a blunted training blade. “You have written stories; now write your opponent’s fate in the air.” Under his guidance I learned the four guards, the lunge, the counter-lunge, and the parry-riposte. My musician’s fingers found a new rhythm in the delicate rotations of the hilt.

In the evenings I returned to my lodging exhausted and exhilarated. The songs I played were slower, more thoughtful, each chord shaped by the day’s lessons. The city around me was still new, but within the Fechtschule I had found a teacher whose ambition matched his skill. He spoke of codifying techniques, of printing books that would be read across the Empire. I realised that I was witnessing the birth of a new art, and that my own journey would be part of that story.
