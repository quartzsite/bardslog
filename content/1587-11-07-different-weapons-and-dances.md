Master Merryen believed that every weapon had its own dance.  \
On the morning after my first lessons he greeted me with a pair of dussacks—curved wooden blades used for training.  \
"These are not swords," he smiled, "they are partners."  \
He showed me how to move with them, how to let the cut flow from my hips and shoulders as if turning through a reel.  \
We practised in pairs, our blades clacking like castanets; sometimes he would clap to set a tempo, sometimes he would hum a tune.  \
Each exercise was a step of a larger choreography: advance, gather, slip, cut, recover.  \
By the afternoon we moved on to the halberd, its reach and weight demanding a slower, statelier measure.  \
Merryen insisted that my feet keep the beat, that my heart keep the rhythm.  \
I began to feel the connection between dance and fight—between the measures I had sung in taverns and the measures I now took on the floor.  \
At dusk I returned to my lodging sore and exhilarated, my head filled not with songs of kings and saints but with the steps of a new dance.
