The hermit known as the Great Grandmaster von Leichtnauer led me deeper into the Blackwood, to a clearing strewn with weathered stumps and carved posts. For three days we practised the Oberhau until my arms sang like strings drawn too tight. Only when he was satisfied did he reveal that there were *other* cuts, secretive and strange – the master strikes of legend.  

Master Merryen might call them something else in Maraisbourg, but here in the silence of the forest the old man gave each its proper name. The *Zornhau* taught me to meet fury with fury, not by force but by structure. The *Krumphau* curved like a question mark around a shield. The *Zwerchhau* taught me to cut across the line, to use my body like a windmill. The *Schielhau* looked at my opponent askance, striking where they least expected. The *Scheitelhau* cut straight down the centre, splitting doubt in two.  

Between each strike he told me of battles long past, of duels fought in rain‑slick streets and of guild politics that pitted master against master in the cities of the empire. His tales were veiled but I knew the names from my songs: Fechtmeister of Nuremberg, ruffians from Vienna, Italian bravos from beyond the mountains. With every story he pressed the point that a cut is born not out of rage but out of intent – that even a killing stroke is a thing of craft.  

At night I wrote by candlelight, fingers blistered, mind buzzing. I realised that my memory of ballads was not wasted; it was a library from which to draw metaphors for each technique. The Zwerchhau was a turning chorus, the Zornhau a defiant refrain. The hermit would sometimes hum along as I practised, a ghost of a tune I could not place. Perhaps he once played a lute too.
