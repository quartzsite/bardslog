# Master Strikes and Hidden Lore  
**1587-10-27**  
*Hermit's Clearing, Blackwood*

Three days of the over-hew until my shoulders hummed with fatigue. Only then did the hermit open the next pages, not from a book but from his posture.

He never spoke the famous name. He did not need to. The phrases were the same I had carried in memory, now set in bone and breath.

We worked them one by one:

- **Zornhau** — meet fury with form; take the center, take the bind, take the line.  
- **Krumphau** — turn the question; short edge, crooked path, long steel made small.  
- **Zwerchhau** — cross the staff; hips carry the cut, arms stay honest.  
- **Schielhau** — look sideways; invite the high hand, answer the eye.  
- **Scheitelhau** — split the doubt; straight down, recovered clean.

Between sets he spoke of rain-slick streets and halls where guild votes weighed more than truth. In one city the same stroke bore another name and was sold as a novelty. In another the masters agreed on nothing but the fee. I knew the stories; I had sung them. Hearing the politics while feeling the timing made both plainer.

“Anger is noise,” he said at last. “Intention is time.” He let that sit. The trees kept still. Far off, a tower bell counted the hour and I matched its beat in the guard.

By candlelight I copied what mattered:

- begin with the hips, end with the point  
- structure beats strength  
- take what is offered, not what is imagined  
- rage rushes; craft arrives

The forest gave no applause. The cuts felt truer for it.
