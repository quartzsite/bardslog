It happened in a low tavern on the Lower Quarter. I had been playing three songs for a bowl of stew when a drunken patron insisted on a fourth without payment. When I refused, he lunged, knocking over mugs. Without thinking I swung my lute up like a shield. The old spruce wood sang a different song that night, catching the edge of a knife and turning it aside. Somewhere in the chaos I found myself stepping wide, keeping measure, my feet moving as though guided by the rhythm of some long‑dead master. Someone shouted "Watch your distance, like Master Merryen teaches!" but I had never met this Merryen. I only knew that my body was moving as if the stories were true.

We circled, he with his dagger and I with a cracked lute. I managed to strike his wrist and send his blade skittering across the floor. Laughter erupted from the gamblers’ table. "Even von Lychenar never wrote of a bard’s guard!" someone jeered. When the scuffle ended I still had my lute, though a piece of its rim splintered like my pride. I realized I had defended myself not with a clever lyric but with motion and nerve.

For the first time since taking up the road I felt something stir in me that was not bitterness. Perhaps I am not just a failure with a song. Perhaps there is a place for me among those who study the dance of blades. The lute bruises on my forearm throbbed as I left the tavern, but in my chest a new melody began — one that might be made with steel.
