It happened in a low tavern in the Lower Quarter. Three songs for a bowl of stew, then a fourth demanded for nothing. I refused. He lunged and the room went to splinters and ale. I brought the lute up like a buckler. Old spruce bit the knife’s edge and lived.

My feet moved on their own—wide step, heel light, the kind of measure I have only heard taught. Someone yelled, “Mind your distance, like Merryen!” I did not know Merryen, but the name landed where my stance should be.

He pressed with a dagger, short and greedy. I gave him a rest. A held beat, no flinch, no sound. He rushed to fill it. I shifted off-line and let the pause spend his arm. The back of the lute kissed his wrist. Steel rang on the floorboards.

The gamblers laughed. “A bard’s guard,” someone said. I checked the rim—cracked but true—then the room, then my breath. I had won nothing worth a song, only space enough to leave and a clearer sense of how to keep it.

I stepped out into the night with a bruised forearm and a problem I wanted to solve properly.
