That night, the guild gathers. They eat, play, recite verses.  
Faelar smiles at them — these students from every city of the fractured Empire — and says only:  
"What began as war became art.  
What began as song became silence.  
Remember both."  
He leaves before dawn. His lute remains on the table.
