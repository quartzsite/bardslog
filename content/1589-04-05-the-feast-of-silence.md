We set the long tables end to end and covered the ink-stains with loaves and stews. Lanterns swung from their hooks, and the noble’s seal above the hearth caught the firelight like a small sun. The monk tuned a borrowed viol; the veteran kept time on the table with two fingers, stern as any drum.

They came from every corner of the fractured Empire—sailors with rope-burned hands, apprentices with chalk still on their boots, a court clerk hiding ink on his cuff, the proud noble with no sword at his hip. We ate. We told the kind of stories that walk backward, softening edges without lying. Someone recited the **Four Voices**; someone else answered with the names of the steps on the star. When a young student faltered on a verse, the room carried him through without remark.

Between courses, the book was opened and passed. Each person read a page and left a word in the margin: _measure_, _breath_, _patience_, _resolve_. The pages smelled of salt and lamp smoke. I watched the faces bend to the light and knew more would be written than I could ever teach.

When the room at last grew quiet, I stood only long enough to say what needed saying:

> What began as war became art.  
> What began as song became silence.  
> Remember both.

No one applauded. They did not need to. The veteran raised his cup; the monk crossed himself; the noble bowed as if before a chapel door. Then the room returned to talking in low voices, and I slipped my lute from its strap and laid it on the table where all could see.

Before dawn, the city still asleep and the tide turning, I chalked the star fresh on the floor and checked the shutters. The writ above the hearth was dry. The book lay open to a blank page edged in gold.

I left by the side door and did not look back.

My lute remained on the table.
