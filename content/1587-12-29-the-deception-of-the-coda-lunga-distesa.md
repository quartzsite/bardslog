Master Maros had us practise a guard he called the **Coda Lunga Distesa**—the Long Extended Tail.

Unlike the high or shoulder guards I had known in the Empire, this posture stretches the arm forward, the point low and toward the foe, shoulders open, weight centred, front knee soft. It felt exposed at first, as if I were offering my hand to be cut.

Maros smiled and said that was its purpose. The Coda Lunga Distesa invites the mistake. When the cut comes for the hand, you slip the forward foot back along a ray of the eight-pointed star, letting the blade pass the line, and answer at once—either with a straight thrust as the hips turn, or with a short, rising cut that catches the withdrawing arm.

He showed how the extended point governs measure, keeping the opponent honest, and how a whisper of the wrist can provoke without committing. “Hold the space,” he said. “Make him spend coin to enter, then charge him double to leave.”

It was a lesson in patience and guile. I remembered the hermit’s warnings about rage and saw that cunning is another road to victory. Holding the Coda Lunga Distesa felt like sustaining a note on my lute just before the melody turns—tension gathering, the resolution sweeter for the wait.
