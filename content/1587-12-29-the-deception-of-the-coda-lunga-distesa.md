Master Maros had us practise a guard he called the Coda\u00a0Lunga\u00a0Distesa, the Long Extended Tail.  \n
Unlike the high guards and shoulder guards of the Empire, this posture stretched the arm forward with the blade low and pointing toward the foe.  \n
At first it felt exposed, as if I were presenting my hand to be cut.  \n
Maros smiled and told me that was its purpose.  \n
The Coda\u00a0Lunga\u00a0Distesa invites an attack and makes the opponent think you are open.  \n
When they take the bait and strike at the hand, you can slip your foot back along one point of the eightâ€‘pointed star and let their blade pass, then answer with a thrust or a cut driven by the hips.  \n
He showed how the extended point controls the measure, keeping the opponent at a respectful distance, and how the slightest motion of the wrist can provoke without committing.  \n
It was a lesson in deception and patience.  \n
I remembered the hermit's warnings about rage and saw that cunning could be another path to victory.  \n
Holding the Coda\u00a0Lunga\u00a0Distesa felt like holding a note on my lute just before the melody changes; tension builds, and then the resolution is all the sweeter.  \n
