The road to Bonona stretched on like an endless ribbon over hills and valleys.  Each day I rose with the sun and walked until the stars came out, my pack light and my limbs heavy.  The cold of the north gave way to damp mists and then to mild breezes, but the distance weighed on me more than the weather.  

Bandits and hungry wolves stalked the roads.  I remembered the hermit's lessons and Merryen's developing cuts when a pair of brigands rushed me with spears.  A fallen branch became my polearm and I thrust and cut with it as if it were a halberd.  When the branch splintered under a blow, I did not despair; I gripped the shorter piece and used it as a dussack, striking with short, sharp cuts that sent the bandits fleeing.  Adaptation was my saving grace.  

Another time, a mounted rider thought to trample me.  With no stick at hand, I unslung my battered lute.  Its neck became a rapier and its body a guard as I slipped under the horse's head and thrust up, not to kill but to startle.  The stringed instrument rang with a discordant note as it tapped the rider's vambrace, and he reined in, more shocked at my audacity than any injury.  He laughed and let me pass; in his eyes I was both bard and swordsman.  

There were nights I thought my legs would buckle and my resolve falter.  I recalled the guild's salute, the hermit's patient gaze and Merryen's last wish.  My songs were still within me, but now they were joined by the memory of master strikes, of developing cuts and of the feel of wood and steel in my hands.  By the time the towers of Bonona appeared on the horizon, red against the winter sky, I felt as if I had walked not just a road but a lifetime.  Relief washed over me, and with it a quiet pride: I had arrived in one piece, forged by the long road itself.
