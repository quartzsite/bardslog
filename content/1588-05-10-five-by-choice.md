We slept two hours after the sluicehouse, then Sura rang the towhouse bell with her knuckles—three soft taps, a pause, then two. Not a summons. A question.

Seventeen men and three boys had gone out on the river with us. Most kept walking. Five stayed when Sura asked, “Who will do **this** again, for strangers?”

They did not look at one another first. They looked at the door we had opened the night before and then at Sura.

Rell, a boatwoman with shoulders like a yoke, set her pole against the hearth and said, “I can count water.”  
Branka the net-mender wiped pitch from her fingers. “I make things hold,” she said.  
Torv, a cartwright, touched the wedge Perkin had left on the table. “I know where weight sits.”  
Issa of the rain-market folded her shawl. “I can talk a gate-keeper into tea,” she said, “and out of a quarrel.”  
Deon the carter lifted a broken pin and a coil of rope. “I carry,” he said simply, “and I don’t ask twice.”

Five—by **choice**, not pay, not vow, not debt.

Sura wrote their names with chalk on the door, below the faded tally the towhouse keeper kept of oats and nail-kegs. Then she drew a small square beside each name and a line between the squares.

“Not a chain,” she said, tapping the line. “A **circuit**. If one breaks, current still runs.”

Perkin spread his board on the table. He had slept with his coal behind his ear and a smile that meant he had been arguing with force in his dreams and had won a point.

“This is what we teach,” he said, sketching as he spoke. “Not the blade first. **Pressure and passage.** Where the load is. Where the bell is. Where people will run when water rises.”

He drew their five marks with shapes instead of letters.

- **Counter** (a circle): keeps numbers, faces, counts first and last.  
- **Key** (a triangle): makes openings—pins, wedges, ratchets, knots, picks.  
- **Hand** (a square): touches danger when touch is needed—**cuts last**.  
- **Voice** (a lozenge): speaks for the work—buys time, borrows calm.  
- **Witness** (an eye): takes names, carries message forward, returns with proof.

“Rotate the marks each night,” Sura added. “No one is the Hand two nights running. The Witness is never the youngest. The Key keeps no key alone.”

Rell nodded, eyes on the board. “And if the bell rings?”

“Then we count again,” Sura said. “We don’t become the red line because the red line is **easier**.”

I wrote the rule-card as they spoke, printing clear so the towhouse girls could copy it for the other milehouses.

> **Cell of Five (by Choice)**  
> **Rule:** Count First.  
> **Preference:** Build a Gate of Mercy; leave Way of Death unwalked unless all other doors are shut.  
> **Method:** Key before Hand. Cover the counting. Carry the fallen. Witness for the next five.  
> **Rotation:** Marks change with sunrise.  
> **Boundaries:** No oath demanded. A door out is always open.

Issa tapped the word **oath**. “You will not bind us?”

Sura looked at the open towhouse door and the road beyond it. “Binding holds bread to the board. We are not bread. Stay because you would wish strangers to stay for you. Go when you must. Tell us you go. That is enough.”

Torv turned the wedge in his palm—Perkin’s butcher’s blessing, smooth now with handling. “What happens to us if we are taken?”

Perkin answered that one. “You will have learned to see wheels and bells and weight. They will not be able to unlarn you. You will find each other again because you will notice the same things other people step over.”

We tested the circuit in the yard behind the towhouse. Branka as **Key** tied a sailor’s bend around the axle of a grain-cart; Deon as **Hand** levered the wheel with a pry, not to break but to ease. Rell as **Counter** called out the inches to the pebble on the ground. Issa as **Voice** kept a curious constable talking about his aunt’s rheumatism. I as **Witness** wrote down how many breaths each part took.

“Work of rescue,” Sura said, mostly to herself. “Not reprisal. We will have to write that line twice before it sticks.”

Rell shouldered her pole again. “Then write it,” she said. “We’ll walk it.”

Perkin took a knife and shaved the chalked square beside each name into the wood with the knife’s back so the rain wouldn’t wash it out by supper. He drew a small map under the names: towpath, milestones, bell-marks, sluices, markets, and where we had heard rumors of press-yards and levy-holds.

“On the twenty-second,” he said, tapping the board where four roads met, “I will be there. **Bring me what you’ve counted**—faces and bells, where force sits, where a gentle push opens ten doors.” He looked at me. “We will open this map. It is no good folded.”

Rell looked at the five shapes again, then at the road. “Who tells the next five?”

Issa already had the shawl on her shoulders and a loaf wrapped in paper. “The Witness,” she said, smiling. “Which is me, until sunrise.”

We stood by the towhouse door and did the small thing Sura had taught us instead of oaths: we lined up the backs of our hands, five across, palm-down so no one had to offer or refuse a clasp. On Sura’s count we lifted together and set down together. Not a pledge. A **measure**.

I played as they walked—four notes rising, a pause, then a fifth that held and did not resolve. The tune would be easy to teach. On the road beyond Mile Twelve, the freed men who had kept walking would hear it somewhere, months from now, and know the shape of the door because it sounded like **breath held, breath given**.

At dusk, the towhouse keeper rubbed at the chalk and swore when it didn’t vanish. “Fine,” she said, half to Sura, half to the door. “Leave your marks. But if your five break my benches with their cleverness, you’ll mend them.”

“We will,” Branka said over her shoulder, not turning. “We make things hold.”

Sura waited until their backs were small on the straight line of the towpath. “This is the part people call slow,” she told me. “It isn’t. This is the part where the thing becomes **many**.”

“Five by choice,” I said, under my breath, to keep from naming them out loud and making them less free.

“Five by choice,” Sura agreed. “And the next five after them will think it was their idea.”
