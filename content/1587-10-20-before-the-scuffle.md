I have spent another season wandering from tavern to tavern, singing ballads that no one seems to hear. The coin tossed at my feet rarely buys a night's lodging. The nobles want bawdy jests, the dockmen want drinking songs, but no one cares for the chronicles of our world. The wars between empires and cityâ€‘states rage across the seas, but all the Lower Quarter cares for is the next mug of ale.

I feel like a ghost in my own life. Each verse is a plea for someone to see me, yet the rooms chatter over me as though I were part of the furniture. My lute is my only companion. I know the tales of Master Merryen of Maraisbourg and the mysterious Grandmaster von Leichtnauer, though I have never seen their forms. I could recite the duels of the League of the Three Cities and the intrigues of Bonona and Lynden as if they were plays, but this knowledge fills my mind and empties my purse.

Perhaps tomorrow will be different. Perhaps not. I write this so that if there is ever a change, I will remember who I was before. A failed bard. A man whose voice felt small. A singer whose stories hung like smoke in the rafters.
