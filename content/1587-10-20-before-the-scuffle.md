I spent another season sliding from tavern to tavern, singing to rooms that would not listen. Coin hit the floor like rain through rotten shingles. It was never enough for a bed. The nobles wanted jokes. The dockmen wanted a chorus they could shout. No one wanted the chronicle.

I kept the chronicle anyway. Wars moved like weather beyond the reefs, but the Lower Quarter watched only the next mug. I wrote that down in the margins of my songbook, along with the names people used as charms: Master Merryen of Maraisbourg, Grandmaster von Lychenar. I had never seen either. I knew them as shapes carried by other mouths.

The red towers came up in murmurs. Old signal fires between Bonona and Maraisbourg, soon to be shaved square and retuned for stone. A priest would put his ear to a seam and declare what the rock had learned. Some called that progress. Some called it theft. I wrote both.

Nights blurred. Three songs for stew. Four for nothing. When a table asked for silence I gave them silence and the room swelled to cover it. My lute felt heavier with every empty verse, but my hands still kept time.
