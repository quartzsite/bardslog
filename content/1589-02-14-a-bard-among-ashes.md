The road led me to a quiet monastery that had once hosted lively Fechtschule tournaments.  
Now its halls were hushed; monks bent over psalters by candlelight, their quills scratching like insects.  
A scent of wax and old paper hung in the air, so different from the tang of steel and sweat.  

The abbot recognized the sword at my side and bade me follow.  
He unlocked a chest in the scriptorium and lifted the lid to reveal confiscated treatises — works of Great Grandmaster Lychenar, Master Merryen, and Master Maros, bound in leather and wrapped in cloth.  
He touched them as if they were relics and asked, "Were these men heretics?"  

"No," I told him, my fingers tracing the familiar diagrams. "Just musicians who used iron instead of strings."  
He smiled, perhaps at my choice of words, and left me alone with the books.  

For three nights I sat by candlelight, copying fragments by hand.  
My pen whispered along the parchment, preserving guards and cuts, verses and measures.  
I wrote not for myself but for those yet to come, knowing that the act of copying was itself an act of hope.  

When dawn painted the abbey windows gold on the fourth morning, I sealed the pages and placed them back in the chest.  
I asked the abbot to hide them in the archives where no soldier would think to search.  
He crossed himself and agreed.  

As I left, the bells tolled a slow, steady hymn.  
I stepped into the ash-scented wind carrying the seeds of a new art tucked safely in someone else’s care.
