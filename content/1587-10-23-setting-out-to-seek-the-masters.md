On the morning after I sold my lute and took up the waster, I turned my steps toward the distant Rhine. The road out of the city seemed both more open and more treacherous than ever before. I have heard songs of long journeys all my life, but to feel the cobbles under my own boots and the weight of my own provision sack is something else entirely.  
I have resolved to seek instruction from the greatest masters of our age â€” or at least their shadows. In Maraisbourg there is said to be Master Merryen, a man who weaves footwork and flourish like a dance; his students speak of measure and winding as if of poetry. Further along I hope to find the Great Grandmaster von Lychenar, whose verses and cryptic glosses have guided swordsmen for generations. In Lynden there is Master Carlen Rowen, a salt-tongued veteran who teaches the guard of St. George with a flourish; and in Bonona I have heard of Master Aquil Maros whose treatises on the rapier whisper from canal to canal. There are others, too: Mistress Fioretta of the Hidden Garden who knows the dagger as if it were a sewing needle; Old Sabien of the Steppe who can fell a man with a polearm before you can blink.  
These names are part of the lore I have told others for years. Now I will learn if the stories are true, and if I am worthy of them. I leave behind a world that offered me little coin for my songs; I walk toward one that may offer bruises and bruising truths. May this logbook keep me honest, and may I find the courage to write in it when my hands are blistered.
