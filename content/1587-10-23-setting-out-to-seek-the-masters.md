At first light I bought a wooden sword with my last clean coins and slung my lute across my back. The road beyond the gate felt wider than any song I had ever sung, yet narrowed by purpose. The cobbles gave way to ruts and frost-stiff grass; the air smelled of smoke from fields already thinking of winter.

I have only one thread to follow: the name carried in old verses—**Great Grandmaster Lychenar**. The songs say he walked out of cities and into trees, where steel could learn to be quiet. If I can reach Maraisbourg, perhaps the woods beyond will hold a hut with a swept threshold, a stump worn smooth by practice, a chalked line where a blade once began its measure.

I do not know who else teaches, or where. I know only that Lychenar’s words have led men from confusion into form. If they can lead me, I will follow them into the dark of the forest and the colder dark within myself.

Let this logbook keep me honest when the blisters come. The lute will remind me I was once a singer; the wooden sword will teach my hands a truer tune.
