At first light I made my way to the road beyond the gate felt wider than any song I had ever sung, yet narrowed by purpose. The cobbles gave way to ruts and frost-stiff grass; the air smelled of smoke from fields already thinking of winter.

I have only one thread to follow: the name carried in old versesâ€”**Great Grandmaster Lychenar**. The songs say he walked out of cities and into trees, where steel could learn to be quiet. I will search for him. Perhaps the woods beyond hide him.
