I left Maraisbourg with only my lute and the weight of ash in my lungs.  
The Empire's roads wound through fields and forests, past the charred husks of villages where Fechtschules once stood.  
At each burned hall I carved a verse into a beam or a tree, a fragment of Merryen's compass or a line of Lychenar's song, as if words could keep the wind from carrying them away.  
I thought often of the hermit in his forest and wondered if any green remained unscorched.  
Once, bandits sprang from the roadside, their blades bright with rust. I did not cut them, only the cords that held their weapons. The blades fell useless at their feet.  
They stared, unsure, and one whispered, "The silent bard." They ran, leaving me with the echo of their boots in the mud.  
The world had grown cruel, but the sword in my hand felt different now â€” less a weapon than a compass, pointing me toward something I had not yet named.
