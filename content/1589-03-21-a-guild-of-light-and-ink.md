By candle and daylight we became a guild without charter. The tables that once held ale now bore quills and blades side by side; the monk’s steady hand traced circles and stars while I set verses in the margins so the motions would not slip from memory when bruises faded.

We copied what could be salvaged—fragments from Lychenar’s cryptic lines, scraps of Maraisbourg drills remembered by heart, notes from Bonona’s compass written from feel rather than theft. For each figure on the page there was a stanza: measure to mark distance, breath to keep tempo, a single word to remind the hand where the edge must turn. Half-art, half-scripture.

Travelers stopped in the doorway to watch the “singing swordsmen.” Some stayed to learn; some only to listen. I would not place a price upon it. “Keep the art free,” I told them. “Coin dulls what it cannot buy.” The veteran who had once challenged me kept order with a nod and a hard stare; the young and proud found their pride polished rather than sharpened.

I named the students **Keepers of the Measure**. Their duties were simple and strict: sweep the floor before and after, hold the lanterns when light failed, copy a page for every lesson they received, and teach a single thing they understood to the next pair who asked. If a stranger had no sword, we gave him a stick; if he had no stick, we drew a line on the floor and taught him to step.

Word wandered farther than we did. A broker swore a courtier’s carriage had paused outside at dusk; a dockhand swore he saw a noble’s son drilling our parries alone on the quay. Whether true or not, the rumor worked like a choir behind the melody. The Crescent Hearth filled each afternoon and quieted each night with the scratch of quill and the soft thud of practice cuts stopped short of flesh.

We argued sometimes—about names, about forms, about who had the right to say what was proper. When voices rose I opened the book and pointed to the blank space left on each page. “For amendment,” I said. “For what tomorrow teaches that we do not know today.” The monk smiled and gilded the corners of that emptiness until it shone.

Once, a trader offered silver for the whole manuscript-in-progress. I closed the cover and pushed it back across the table. “You can have a copy,” I said, “if you leave a copy behind.”

So the book grew and multiplied: light for eyes grown tired, ink for hands grown sure. The hearth kept warm; the star on the floor did not wear out. And though we had no charter, no seal, no lord’s permission, the city treated us as something that had always been meant to exist—like a tune everyone knew but had forgotten how to start.
