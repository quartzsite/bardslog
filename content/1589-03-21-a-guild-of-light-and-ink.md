The guild prospers. They copy old treatises, writing verses beside diagrams — half-art, half-scripture.  
Travelers come to watch the “singing swordsmen.”  
Faelar refuses to charge coin; he says the art must remain free.  
He names his students “The Keepers of the Measure.”  
Rumors spread that even nobles seek their instruction — not in war, but in bearing.
