He came with rain on his cloak and pride in his step. “They say you teach cowards’ art,” he said, loud enough for the tavern to hear.

I stepped into the street. The cobbles were slick; the air smelled of salt and wet rope. He drew bright steel. I slipped the strap from my shoulder and set the lute against my forearm like a small, ridiculous shield.

“Name your measure,” I said.

He lunged. **Wind** carried me aside; **Stone** caught his cut on the lute’s rim; **Water** flowed parry into parry; **Flame** flashed only once—when his haste left him open. I rode the bind, traced a Bonona step on the rain-dark star, and set a thrust an inch from his heart.

He froze. The rain did not.

“**Learn the pause between notes,**” I said, and lowered the point.

The street went very quiet, the way a hall does when a song ends well. He knelt—not from humiliation, but from understanding—and then rose with a different weight in his shoulders.

“My insult was loud,” he said. “My apology will be louder.”

He sent his steward running. By dusk the man returned with a small retinue: a clerk with ink, a sergeant of the watch, and a narrow box that held seals and ribbon. The noble wrote by lantern light, the rain ticking on the panes.

“Here is my hand and seal,” he said at last. “Letters of surety, safe-conduct within the city and its liberties, and a patent of recognition for instruction in the art of arms. Let those who squabble for primacy—the Feather Guild and the Mark-Brothers—quarrel at court; you will have my voice at council.”

The clerk sanded the page; the sergeant witnessed; the steward pressed the wax until the device took. We hung the writ above the hearth, where the heat would keep the ink dry and the light would find it first.

Word ran faster than the rain. By morning sailors nodded at us as at a chartered house; apprentices bowed before stepping across the threshold; even a bailiff doffed his cap as he passed. The Crescent Hearth had been a rumor; now it had a seal.

The noble returned at first light with no sword on his hip.

“Teach me the pause,” he said.

We began with measure.
