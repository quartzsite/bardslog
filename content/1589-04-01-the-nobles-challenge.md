A young noble, arrogant and prideful, arrives to test Faelar. "They say you teach cowards' art," he sneers.  
Faelar accepts. The duel takes place in the rain.  
Faelar's every parry sings â€” each movement perfectly timed, each step tracing Bonona's compass.  
The noble lunges too fast; his blade snaps.  
Faelar touches his shoulder with the flat and says, "Learn the pause between notes."  
The noble kneels, shamed yet enlightened.
