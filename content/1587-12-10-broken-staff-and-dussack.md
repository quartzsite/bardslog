A week into my journey south the weather turned sour and the road narrowed through a forest of bare trees.  \nBandits came from the brush as I rounded a bend, thinking to find an easy mark.  \nI grasped a fallen branch and held it like the polearms I had drilled with in the hermit's clearing.  \nThey laughed until the first thrust drove one of them back.  \n  \nWhen a heavy sword stroke shattered my makeshift staff in two, I did not panic.  \nI recalled the lessons of the dussack and shifted my grip, swinging the thicker half as a singleâ€‘edged blade.  \nThe wood whistled through the air and bit into a shoulder; the bandits scattered, more startled by my resolve than by any wound.  \n  \nAs I stood amid the broken pieces, I realized that every weapon is only as strong as the hands and mind that wield it.  \nThe road to Bonona was teaching me to adapt, to let the strikes of my enemies carve new forms into my practice.  \nWith the broken staff in one hand and my lute slung over the other, I continued on, wary but unafraid.
