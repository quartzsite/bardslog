A week into my journey south the weather turned sour, and the road narrowed through a stand of leafless trees. As I rounded a bend, three men slid out of the brush with the easy confidence of those who have robbed before.

I caught up a fallen branch and leveled it as I had the polearms in the hermit’s clearing—hands apart, back heel rooted, breath steady. They laughed until the first thrust struck like a ram against a shield, driving one man stumbling into the ruts.

A heavy cut crashed down and shattered my makeshift staff in two. I did not panic. Merryen’s dussack lesson rose in my hands without bidding. I slid my grip, let the thicker length become a single-edged blade, and cut on the short arc—shoulder, wrist, then the back of the hand that reached for me. Wood whistled; knuckles split; courage wavered.

They pressed once more and found only angles. I stepped off on a slant, let their force pass, and answered with a turning blow that clipped bone without breaking it. Steel hissed back into sheaths not out of honour but calculation; they decided a singing stranger with a broken stick was not the easy prize they wanted.

When the road was mine again, I stood amid bark and splinters and felt something settle. A weapon is only what your structure, timing, and will make of it. The road to Bonona was teaching me to let misfortune shape the form of my answers.

With the broken length tucked through my belt and my lute slung across my back, I walked on—warier than before, but unafraid.
