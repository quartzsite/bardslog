After weeks of travel and trials, Bonona greeted me with more than just its towers. In the heart of a wide piazza, I witnessed a duel unlike any fight I had seen. A silver‑haired master in a dark doublet faced a brash young noble. They saluted with grace, measuring distance with a practiced ease. Their footwork traced circles on the flagstones, their blades sang like lutes in counterpoint. In the end the master disarmed his opponent without drawing blood, a flourish that spoke of respect rather than contempt.

The crowd whispered his name – Aquil Maros – a master from these lands, trained in a refined art. I knew this must be the old friend my dying master had spoken of. I vowed to present myself to him not as a beggar but as a student who had travelled far and learned much. In the morning I would seek him out and deliver Merryen's wish.
