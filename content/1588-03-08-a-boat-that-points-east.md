We began where the water bit least. Two black stones shaped the cove like a jaw; between them we laid our keel: straightest trunk we could fell with a stone edge and patience. Garran split planks with wedges and a mallet of drift; Osric braided bark into cord until his hands bled and then kept braiding. Rell measured by thumb and breath, calling pace like a bosun without a deck.

Fire gave us joinery. We charred dowels, drove them hot, and sealed the seams with resin and fat until they gleamed. Stone gave us shape. Wind gave us a test: we held the frame to the gust and listened for complaint. Water judged last; every launch and leak taught a line we had missed.

We stitched an outrigger from saplings to forgive our errors. We wove a square of reeds for sail and hemmed it with knot-work that told our hands where to find the corners in the dark. The staff-shadow circle we’d set on the bluff now sat in the sand by the hull; every hour I notched the rim. East became a habit.

When the frame at last took a name in our mouths—**Answer**—we did not cheer. We lifted her, step by step, and let the cove drink her. She sat true. The reed square bellied once, and the four of us smiled the same reluctant smile.

If the world would not send a mast, we had built one from the four elements and a promise.
