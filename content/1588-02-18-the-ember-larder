We learned to store heat the way we store grain. Garran dug a pit in the lee of the black rock, lined it with river stones, and roofed it with driftboard and clay. Rell showed me how to bury a coal under ash so it sleeps, and how to wake it with breath that does not waste the morning air. We named the place the ember larder.

Osric’s tally became ember math: one shell of coals for boiling, two for smoke, three only when the wind turned wicked and wet. Fish hung from a frame of oar staves, salt rubbed in with the heel of the hand. Sea birds gave us feathers for kindling and a warning about waste. Flame would be our ally if we treated it like a guest, not a god.

At night the pit’s lid ticked as it cooled. We kept a clay jar warm for resin and pitch, another for drying cord and sail scraps. I wrote the rule on the inside of the lid so we would see it each dawn: **count first, cut last; feed small, keep warm.**

When the sky cleared we dared long smoke, thin and pale, hoping a ship would read it. The horizon kept its counsel. So we laid more fish to cure, sealed resin in corked gourds, and banked the coals again. If rescue would not come, the ember larder would carry us toward it.
