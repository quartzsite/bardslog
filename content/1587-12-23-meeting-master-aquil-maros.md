The morning after the duel, the piazza still hummed with whispers.  The young noble who had faced Master Aquil Maros wore a bandage upon his arm, a thin line of red showing where Maros’s blade had kissed him.  Though wounded, he stood at the edge of the square and publicly thanked his opponent for sparing him greater harm.  It was a strange thing to see: blood on the stones, honour in the air, and no bitterness between them.

I approached the master with my hat in my hands and my lute slung across my back.  I told him of Master Merryen’s passing and of the hermit in the forest, and I delivered Merryen’s dying wish that I seek Maros out.  The master listened without interruption.  When I finished, he placed his hand upon my shoulder and said that any student of Merryen was a friend of his.  He looked me over – a bard with calloused fingers and a swordsman’s stance – and he smiled.  "You carry two arts within you," he said.  "We shall teach them to dance together."

Maros’s manner was different from the blunt discipline of the hermit or the enthusiastic energy of Merryen.  He moved with an upright grace, as if invisible strings held his spine.  Even his gestures had a noble ease, a kind of effortless mastery that the locals called *sprezzatura*.  I felt clumsy and heavy beside him, but he only nodded and told me to return at dawn.
