We set the staff in a socket by the tiller and let noon speak. Shadow on cord. Knot to mark the day. Osric kept the tide count on a slat of drift, one gouge per watch. Garran trimmed the reed square until its belly hummed. Cassian leaned her weight into the outrigger and made the Answer feel larger than she was.

The world proved small by measures we could hold. Stars we knew rose sooner than they should have. A current like a slow rope pulled from under our keel and taught us to tack with patience. We learned to read the sea birds. When they came in a thin line out of the west and cut away to the east, we followed their thinking and found clean water.

We steered by a circle we had carved in our heads. Wind was the hand that moved us. Water was the page we wrote on. Stone was the memory of the island in our bones. Flame was the will that kept us at the tiller when the night went long. I spoke S I N G under my breath like a prayer to keep our tempers even at the shift.

Once a squall rose sharp on the port quarter. Garran wanted to run. I put the bow a hand into it and shortened the sail by two knots. The rain passed like a curtain. After, the sky felt closer.

We ate what the hooks gave and drank what our cloth could catch. At dawn on the thirteenth day a red smear lifted from the edge of the water and would not fade. Cassian did not smile, but she set both hands to the brace. The Answer turned her nose to it like a hound.

The small globe had curved us farther than any chart I had seen. If the smear was land, then west had kept its promise and brought us east.
