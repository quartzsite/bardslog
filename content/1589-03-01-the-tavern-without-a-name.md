In a ruined port city, I sought shelter from the wind and salt spray.  
Among broken docks and charred warehouses stood a half-collapsed tavern with no signboard.  
Inside, a handful of wanderers huddled around a guttering fire: a scarred mercenary with a torn coat, a failed student of Bonona who still carried his sidesword though his eyes were empty, and a monk whose lute had only three strings.  
They shared cheap wine and the sort of grief that needs no words.  

I set my pack down and played a soft tune on the monk’s battered instrument.  
Fingers tapped on tables. Shoulders eased.  
When the song ended, I drew my sword and traced a simple cut through the air.  
Rhythm became motion; motion became rhythm.  
The mercenary’s eyebrows lifted. The failed student laughed for the first time in weeks.  
A drunk in the corner squinted at us and slurred, "Is this a lute fight?"  

I laughed and replied, "Then we’ll make it one."  
We pushed aside overturned benches and chalked a compass star on the floorboards.  
We took turns showing what we knew — German longsword strikes, Bononese flourishes, Lyndener sabre cuts — and found common timing between them.  
By the time the wine was gone and the fire burned low, we had agreed to meet again.  

Out of mockery, music, and memory, something new took shape: a guild with no charter, no patron, no walls.  
We called it, half in jest, **Lutefecht**.  
In the morning, as gulls screamed over the ruined harbour, I felt hope stir like an ember beneath ash.
