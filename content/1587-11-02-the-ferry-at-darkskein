# The Ferry at Darkskein  
**1587-11-02**  
*Darkskein Ferry Hamlet*

River fog pressed low and the ferry rope sang a quiet line. The ferryman took three passengers and a cart. I stood at the bow to watch the current and count the beats in the drift. Halfway over, someone below the planks tapped a pattern that did not belong to river work. Three knocks, a rest, then two. The ferryman did not hear it. The water did.

A pair on the stern worked up a quarrel that felt staged. One shoved the other into the tiller. The cart wheels shifted and grain began to spill. Panic would tip us if it found a chorus. I did not join the noise. I waited for the boat to crest its small sway, then moved.

The shover raised a boat hook like a spear. Space was tight. I took the wide step the hermit taught me and let the hook pass the empty beat. My cross cut caught the shaft and turned it. The old books call it Zwerchhau. The hook shot past the manâ€™s ear and clacked the rail.

The second man had a knife for the rope. He crouched near the fairlead and sawed at the ferry line. I gave him a short Oberhau angled to the wrist. The knife rang and skipped to the scuppers. He snatched for it and found only wet wood.

They tried to rally the passengers with shouts about wardens and hunger. No one moved. The ferryman fixed me with a look that asked a question I could not answer out loud. I shook my head. He set the pole and gave us two long strokes that carried the ferry into the slower water near the far bank.

On the landing stood the stump of a red tower. Mud and char at the base. A seam scar on the face cut like a keyway, older than the new stone work upriver. Someone had traced fresh chalk along the notch. A reply to the taps, or a test.

The pair bolted into reed-light and were gone. The ferryman spat river into the fog and said Darkskein had turned strange since summer. I paid him extra to pull again at once so his deck would not gather listeners. On the path to the road I heard the pilings talk once more. Three knocks. A rest. Two.
