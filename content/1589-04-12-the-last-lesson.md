I set this book beside a narrow stream where alder roots hold the bank and the water moves like breath. If you are reading, you are the student I hoped would find it. The hearth is far behind us now, yet the art lives where two feet can stand and a mind can keep time.

What follows is not a riddle. It is the whole of what I can leave.

## What Lutefecht is

- **Keep the art free.** Teach for love, not for coin. Take a copy, leave a copy.
- **Harm no one you do not have to.** The point of the art is restraint.
- **Honor the Four Voices.**  
  Wind for agility, Stone for grounding, Flame for timing, Water for flow.  
  Let them sing together and you will move true.
- **Hold the Vow of Silence.** We learn the fifth song of war so we can end it. We do not sing it aloud. We stop our blades at the inch.

## The Rule

**Sing before you draw.** Say it every time your hand even thinks of the hilt.

A memory peg for the road:

**S I N G**

**S — Set your breath and stance.**  
One calm breath. Heels under you. Edge aligned in the mind before it is in the hand.

**I — Intend the outcome.**  
Ask what good you mean to do. Protect, not punish. End the quarrel, not the life.

**N — Notice measure.**  
Name the distance. See exits, ground, bystanders. A single step changes a fight into a conversation.

**G — Give grace.**  
Offer words. Offer a pause. Offer a way out. If you must act, act cleanly and stop when the lesson lands.

Write S I N G on your palm if you must. Speak it in your chest. It will slow the blood and clear the eye.

## A practice you can carry

When trouble walks toward you, do this and no more:

1. **Step to safe measure.** A half circle off the line. Feel the eight-pointed star under your soles.
2. **Breathe once.** Count the length of that breath. Let it set your tempo.
3. **Lift your empty hand.** Palm open. Words ready. Name your measure if they will hear it.
4. **Show the bind, not the cut.** If steel must rise, let Wind and Water guide the first touch. A parry that invites calm. A slip that leaves no bruise.
5. **If Flame must speak,** spend only the spark that ends the danger. Stop at the inch. Return to Stone.

Do this until it is a habit. Do it until your students do it without asking why.

## If you must teach

Begin each day with measure and breath. End each day with a page copied in a steady hand. Leave a space on the page for what tomorrow will teach that you do not know today. Sweep the floor before and after. Hold the lantern when light fails. These things matter as much as any guard.

## If you must judge yourself

Ask three questions when the room is quiet.

- Did I spare where I could.  
- Did I speak before I struck.  
- Did I stop at the inch.

If the answers are yes, sleep. If not, make amends and begin again.

## Farewell

I have walked under many roofs and learned from many hands. The hermit’s patience. Merryen’s bright courage. Maros’s compass and the ease that hides hard work. Rowen’s honest edge and sea wind in the lungs. All of them were true. All of them end here, with you.

Close this book. Take one breath. Feel the star under your feet though you cannot see it. When the world asks for the song of war, remember our vow.

**Sing before you draw.**
