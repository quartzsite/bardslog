They say a traveler found the journal beside a narrow stream where alder roots grip the bank and the water moves like breath. The book was wrapped in oilcloth, the edges salt stained, the hand unmistakable. No footprints, only the hush of the wood and the murmur of water over stone.

The last page was written in a steady, unhurried script:

> *I have seen the art of every master, and all of them were true.*  
> *Steel taught me rhythm. Rhythm taught me peace.*  
> *The sword, like the song, ends not with the hand that wields it but with the ear that listens.*  
> *If you have read this far, sing before you draw.*
