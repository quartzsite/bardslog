They say a traveler found the journal beside a narrow stream where alder roots grip the bank and the water moves like breath. The book was wrapped in oilcloth, the edges salt-stained, the hand unmistakable. No footprints, only the hush of the wood and the murmur of water over stone.

The last page was written in a steady, unhurried script:

> *I have seen the art of every master, and all of them were true.*  
> *Steel taught me rhythm. Rhythm taught me peace.*  
> *The sword, like the song, ends not with the hand that wields it but with the ear that listens.*  
> *If you have read this far â€” sing before you draw.*
