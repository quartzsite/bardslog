A traveler finds Faelar's journal beside a stream near the forest where it all began.    
The last entry reads:    
I have seen the art of every master, and all of them were true.    
Steel taught me rhythm. Rhythm taught me peace.    
The sword, like the song, ends not with the hand that wields it but with the ear that listens.    
If you have read this far â€” sing before you draw.
