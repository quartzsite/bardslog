The southern road was long and the nights were growing colder when I came upon a wayside inn that was bursting at the seams.  
Inside, merchants and mercenaries jostled for space, their tempers as sharp as their knives.  
Before I had even ordered a mug of ale, two rival caravans began shouting about spilled wine and stolen cargo, hands inching toward sword hilts.  
My hand went to my own blade, but another instinct stirredâ€”older than the master strikes.  
I slung my lute around and began to play a song my mother had taught me, a tune about a brave sailor who outwitted a storm.  
Voices hushed as the melody wound through the room, and soon rough hands were tapping on tables instead of reaching for steel.  
By the time the last verse floated into the rafters, the quarrel had melted into laughter and clinking cups.  
It felt good to know that while I had become a fighter, I had not lost the bard's power to calm a room.  
Sometimes a song can be a shield just as surely as a sword can be.
