I left the cobbles of the city behind today and stepped into the Blackwood, following rumors of a hermit who knew the blade like no other.  
The pines whispered with stories older than any of my songs. My lute bounced at my side, its cracked frame a reminder of the Smoky Hearth and of the path that brought me here.  
After hours of walking, I found a small clearing where an old man was splitting logs with motions so precise they could have been written in notation. He looked up with piercing eyes that seemed to hold centuries.  
When I gave my name he laughed and said names are as light as feathers. He called himself nothing at all, yet when he took up a stick his posture and cuts matched the descriptions of the mysterious Grandmaster vonâ€¯Leichtnauer that I had recited in taverns.  
We spoke of battles fought in the Empire and the Mediterranean, of condottieri and mercenaries, of princes who paid for armies while poets starved. He told me that steel is a verse you must learn to read and write.  
Tomorrow he will begin to show me the first true strike. My heart beats faster than it ever did when stepping onto a stage.
