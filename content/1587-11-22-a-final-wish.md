When Master Merryen could no longer stand, his students carried him to a small chamber above the hall. The once vibrant man lay among rough blankets, his skin ashen, his breathing shallow.  

He summoned me with a crooked finger. I knelt beside him with my lute across my knees, unsure whether he wanted a song or a promise.  

"You have heart and hands in equal measure," he whispered. "I have taught you all that I can in this place. There is an old friend far to the south, in a city of red towers. Seek him. He will teach you to make your cuts sing."  

I understood that he meant Bonona, a distant land whose scholars were said to fence like poets. He told me the name of his friend — Aquil Maros — a man who had taken the art and made it elegant.  

"Do not put down your lute," he added, his eyes glistening. "Music has carried you this far, and it will keep you whole when steel threatens to harden you."  

I promised him I would travel when the winter broke. He smiled and closed his eyes, his hand squeezing mine once before going limp. Every path ends, but another begins.
