The road from Maraisbourg stretched out before me like a ribbon of muddy brown and autumn gold.  
I left the city with the sound of the guild's salute still ringing in my ears and the weight of Master Merryen's final wish on my shoulders.  
As I walked, the spires of the cathedral faded into the mist and were replaced by rolling fields, small villages and the long sweep of the river.  
Every innkeeper and ferryman I met asked if I were a soldier or a minstrel; I told them I was both, and that felt true.  
I practised the master strikes in the morning dew and hummed old ballads by the fire at night, noticing how the rhythm of my steps matched the rhythm of my cuts.  
The journey itself was shaping me, forging patience and endurance.  
For the first time, I understood that the blade is not only tempered in the heat of battle but also along the dusty roads that lead to new horizons.
