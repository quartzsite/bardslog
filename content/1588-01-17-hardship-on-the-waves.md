The days after the pirate attack blurred into grey skies and creaking timber.  
The wind turned against us, and the Westward Trader crawled.  
Barrels of fresh water ran low; biscuits went hard and weeviled.  
Sickness crept among the men like a silent boarding party.  
I did what I could: I rationed the water assigned to me, shared a tune each night to steady hands and hearts, and reminded them how to move their feet even when their bellies were empty.  
But hunger breeds anger.  
Whispers of unfair shares and hoarded casks began to circulate with the rats.  
Faces that had grinned when they called me Master now looked hollow and watchful.  
The captain held fast to his authority and his ledger, and he told me in private that land was still weeks away.  
I thought of the eightâ€‘pointed star and how every step has a return, every lunge a recovery.  
We were on a path with no clear retreat.  
I began to feel the ship itself as a weapon drawn and held too long, shaking with strain.
