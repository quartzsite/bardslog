The morning after my arrival, I wandered through Bonona's squares until a crowd gathered in a marble courtyard.  \nThere, under the gaze of ancient statues, two men saluted each other with side‑swords: one, a silver‑haired master whose movements were like flowing water; the other, a proud young noble in bright silk.  \n\nTheir duel was not a brawl but a conversation.  \nThey circled and cut from the guards I had learned in Strasbourg, but there was a refinement to their posture that I had never seen.  \nThe master let the noble press him, turning each attack aside with a wrist‑flick or a precise step, answering with thrusts that stopped short of flesh.  \n\nWhen at last he disarmed the noble with a deft bind and twist, the crowd erupted into applause rather than cheers.  \nHonour satisfied, both men embraced.  \nSomeone whispered to me that the master was Aquil Maros, a teacher of the old Bolognese school and an old friend of Merryen.  \n\nI knew then that my path had led me true.  \nI would seek an audience with Master Maros and present Master Merryen's dying wish.  \nAs the crowd dispersed, I placed a hand on my lute, reminded that there are as many songs in the sword as there are strings in wood.
