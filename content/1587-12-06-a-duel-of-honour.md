The morning after my arrival, I wandered through Bonona's squares until a crowd gathered in a marble courtyard. There, under the gaze of ancient statues, two men saluted each other with side-swords: one, a silver-haired master whose movements were like flowing water; the other, a proud young noble in bright silk.

Their duel was not a brawl but a conversation. They circled and cut from the guards I had learned in Maraisbourg, yet there was a refinement to their posture I had never seen. The master let the noble press him, turning each attack aside with a wrist-flick or a precise step, answering with thrusts that stopped short of flesh.

At last he disarmed the noble with a deft bind and twist, and the crowd erupted into applause rather than cheers. Honour satisfied, both men embraced. Someone whispered that the master was Aquil Maros, a teacher of the old Bononese school and an old friend of Merryen.

I knew then that my path had led me true. I would seek an audience with Master Maros and present Master Merryen's dying wish. As the crowd dispersed, I placed a hand on my lute, reminded that there are as many songs in the sword as there are strings in wood.
