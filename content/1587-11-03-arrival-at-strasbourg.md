The road from the Blackwood to Strasbourg was longer than any path I had walked alone. Villages gave way to vineyards and then to the broad, flat fields where mercenaries drilled and farmers harvested side by side. At each inn I earned my supper by singing, and each night I practised the strikes the hermit had taught me behind barns and under starlight. Word of a bard carrying a practice sword preceded me; some scoffed, others listened.  

When the towers of Strasbourg finally rose before me on 3 November 1587, my breath caught. The city walls bristled with cannon and banners, the gates thronged with merchants, soldiers and pilgrims. Above it all the cathedral spire pierced the grey sky like a blade. I felt suddenly small and exhilarated. Inside these walls lived masters of the sword and masters of words, guilds that controlled trade routes, and councils that argued about more than bread and taxes.  

As I crossed the stone bridge and entered through the gate, I could hear a dozen languages mingling. A cart rolled past carrying barrels of wine labelled from the Rhineland. A group of burghers argued about tolls, while a pair of Landsknechte in slashed sleeves laughed and compared bruises. I asked a boy selling apples if he knew of a fencing master named Merryen. “The young master at the Fechtschule near the Tanner's Quarter?” he replied, eyes widening. “Everyone knows him. He's rewriting the books.”  

I found lodging at a modest tavern near the fish market. I tuned my lute and played quietly by the window, watching the street as the light faded. Tomorrow I would seek out Master Merryen. Tonight I let the city teach me its rhythms: clattering hooves, church bells, the murmur of deals, the occasional clink of steel. Each was a note in the song of this new chapter.
