The road rose from the marsh on pilings that once held ropes. No bodies now, only creak and bell and a scatter of ribbons. Each beam had a pin at its crown. From the pins ran lines to the sky.

A boy ran ahead of us with a reel at his hip. The frame at the end of his line was a kite built from thin bone and lacquered paper. It climbed and steadied, then tipped twice, then held. Wind approved with a clean pull. Stone counted poles to either side and marked where the planks bowed.

Two wardens waited at the bend, coats the color of dry reeds. Between them stood a woman with a spool as wide as a shield. Her hands were scarred where cord had burned through skin and healed. She wore no sword. That was courtesy.

I let S I N G take me. Set stance on sound footing. Intend safe passage and true words. Notice how the lines spoke to one another across the sky, how each tug carried a meaning. Give grace with an open palm and the words we had learned at the jetty.

She called herself Kitebone, keeper of the road’s breath. She asked for our names, our number, our boat mark. I gave them and added the count of kites in the air. She nodded at that. Count first, cut last, she said, as if she knew the rule already.

The wardens set a little chalk star on the plank. I stepped to its edge. Kitebone traced a circle around my boots and looked up. A red pennant turned once on a distant frame. Another line paid out. The road began to talk.

Three short pulls from the west: a wagon. One long from the south: a runner. Two long from the pagoda roofs: stand ready. The boy’s bone frame ticked like an insect. Flame wanted to ask about the wreck and our dead but I kept it banked. This was not a place for lament. This was a place for count and reply.

Kitebone spoke low. There is a man in the hill house who builds machines that climb walls. The sun banners will test the locks at dawn. If you came for trade, trade quick. If you came for help, teach us how to hold a line.

Wind tugged the kite cloth. Water pressed the marsh to our ankles. Stone fixed the span numbers in memory. I gave grace again and offered a tune on the small drum, a slow beat to match their pulls. The boy grinned. The line answered.

At dusk she set a marker on our sleeve: a strip of lacquered ribbon, yellow on one face, black on the other. Turn the black out if you must speak in haste, she said. Turn it back if you only pass. We crossed the last span with the ribbon bright as a little sun.

That night the road sang to itself. I learned its chorus and heard a single deep pull that did not repeat. Somewhere a winch was woken.
