# The Grain-Yard Feint  
**1587-11-01**  
*Mill Quarter outside Mulecrest*

The mill stream ran cold and loud. Grain dust hung in the air. I heard the sacks before I saw the men. Canvas scraped the yard stones in a hurried rhythm that did not match the watch bell. Two figures shoved a stack toward the gate and shouted for help as if wardens were already on them. It felt practiced. A cry for witnesses before the theft was even done.

I kept to the dark under the eaves and watched their measure. One lingered near the gate with a cudgel. The other dragged sacks and cut seals thin with a small knife. When a lantern swung at the lane mouth they began to bawl that the wardens were stealing winter grain. The cudgel man rushed the light to make panic do the rest.

I stepped out at angle and kept distance. He chopped high. I let the strike pass across an empty beat and answered with a crooked cut that came from the shoulder and turned his wrist. The old books would call it a Krumphau. To me it felt like hooking a false note and laying it flat. His hand opened. The cudgel fell and thumped the yard.

The knife man darted in to blind my eyes with dust. I gave a short advance, then a half step back. That small rest broke his time. The point of my waster kissed his sleeve and made him think twice. He ran for the alley. The other limped after him, swearing that wardens would pay for this. The lantern bearer lowered the light and spat husk from his tongue.

Wardens arrived late, as they do when panic is planned. We found seals shaved to look broken and chalk marks on the yard post. A hand print. Three fingers dragged down, two clean. Someone is mapping routes and rehearsing crowds. A millerâ€™s boy said men in ash cloaks were seen by the ferry two nights ago. He could not name them. He knew the smell of pitch on cloth.

I swept grain from my boots and left before my name could land in the ledger. The stream kept its beat. The stones held their silence. On the road I practiced the crooked cut against my own shadow until the hook lived in the hips and not the hands.
