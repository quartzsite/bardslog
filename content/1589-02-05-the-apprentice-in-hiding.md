In an alley between the ruins of Maraisbourg, I heard the whisper of steel where none should be.  
A skinny boy was there, swinging a stick as if it were Merryenâ€™s blade, tracing faded compass steps in the mud. He moved alone and desperate, repeating footwork he had seen once in stolen pages.  
When I stepped from the shadows he froze. He told me, haltingly, that he had been apprenticed to a printer. Before the guilds fell, his master had been paid to copy sword manuals. When the purges came, the presses were smashed and the printer fled. The boy stayed behind with only fragments of diagrams and a memory of the art.  
I broke bread with him. I corrected his stance and showed him a single true parry, how to meet force and turn it aside without violence. His hands were quick; his eyes, hungry.  
That night the soldiers marched through the quarter burning what they called traitor manuscripts. Smoke curled above the roofs. In the darkness we slipped past patrols and ash, clutching the rescued pages to our chests. I led him out by a gate few remembered, and put him on a cart bound north with farmers who asked no questions.  
As the cart creaked away he looked back and asked if anyone would keep the art alive.  
"They will," I told him, though I had yet to decide how.  
When I turned back toward the city, I felt something stir within me. It was not anger at the soldiers or sorrow for the dead masters. It was a sense of responsibility, a weight like a promise.  
A master is not the one who strikes the hardest, but the one who keeps the song alive.
