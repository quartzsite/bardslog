The morning after I agreed to train under Master Carlen Rowen, he led me to a patch of flattened grass behind his cottage.  
Rowen carried two curved blades with knuckle guards and pommels shaped like horse heads. "These aren't your Bononese spaghet‐twirlers," he said with a grin. "This is a sabre; it sings a rougher tune."  
He had me stand tall with chest high and feet wide, then showed me how to cut in great arcs from the shoulder. The strikes were unlike the precision of Maros's compass star or the wrathful overcuts of von Lychenar — here, it was about momentum and flow, letting the blade's curve do the work.  
Rowen mocked the tucked‑in guards of the south, calling them "delicate as lace", and said the free cities had always favored honesty of motion over clever feints. "We fight to keep our towns free," he added quietly. "Your Bononese masters fence for courts and coin."  
We stepped and cut across an imaginary eight‑pointed star drawn in the dirt, but Rowen's version was looser; he encouraged me to move from the waist and hips, to blend steps like a dance and to turn my cuts into defence and attack in one.  
As sweat ran down my brow, I realized how much my arms still remembered the lute. The sabre's rhythm was faster, more percussive, but there was music in it too.  
Rowen laughed when I said so. "Aye, lad. Every blade speaks a different language. Learn to listen, and you'll never be tongue‑tied."  
By sunset my shoulders burned and my fingers blistered, yet I felt invigorated. Each master had shown me a new facet of the art; with Rowen I would learn to cut through the wind and let the Empire's sea air fill my lungs.
