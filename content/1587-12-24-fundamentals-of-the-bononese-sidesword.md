Master Maros led me through a heavy wooden door into his sala d'armi, a hall flooded with morning light and lined with polished swords.  The air smelled of oiled steel and chalk.  In the centre of the floor he drew an eight‑pointed star, each line radiating outward like the petals of a compass rose.  “These are your roads now,” he said.  “Every step you take will follow one of these paths.”  I stood at the centre and felt the space open around me.  

He began by adjusting my stance.  Gone was the crouched, forward‑leaning guard of the longsword.  My chest had to be open, shoulders relaxed, back straight—like a noble greeting a prince.  My left hand floated near my heart as if ready to pluck a string.  Each cut he showed me began and ended in a guard with the elegance of a bow.  He called this *sprezzatura*, the art of making hard things seem effortless.  The eight‑pointed star kept me honest: step forward to the top point for a thrust; step to the side points for evasion; withdraw to the back point without losing poise.  

At first my feet tangled themselves and my cuts hung heavy.  But then I found a rhythm, the same inner metronome that guides a melody.  The compass lines guided my measure, and the blade seemed to float ahead of me rather than drag behind.  Where the hermit had taught me raw power and Master Merryen had shown me developing cuts, Master Maros taught me grace.  By the end of the lesson my arms ached, yet my spirit was light.  Uprightness and measured steps, he said, would make the sword sing.  As I left the hall, I felt as if I had learned the first notes of a new song.
