I hid myself among barrels and rope as the Westward Trader slipped away from Bonona's docks.  
My plan was simple: ride the waves until fate placed me on a new shore.  
But within a day a sailor's boot nudged my ribs, and I was hauled before the captain.  
He could have thrown me overboard or chained me to the pump; instead he set a brush in my hand and ordered me to earn my passage swabbing decks.  
The punishment stung my pride more than my back, yet it gave me time to watch.  
These men were sailors, not fighters; their hands were sure on lines but uncertain on hilts.  
When I mentioned that I had studied under masters in Strasbourg and Bonona, the captain's eyes narrowed with interest.  
He asked me to show him a cut, then another.  
Soon the swabbing brush was traded for a stick, and I chalked an eight‑pointed star on the planks.  
We spent calm mornings practising footwork and simple cuts—the circling molinero, the descending stremaçone, the thrusts that follow.  
At first the crew laughed, tripping over each other, but by the third day they moved as one.  
When a lean raider brig unfurled black sails on the horizon, our drills were tested.  
The pirates swung hooks and axes, but the sailors kept their lines tight and their points true.  
We drove them back over the gunwales with more courage than I had expected.  
Afterwards, the crew slapped my shoulders and called me “Master Faelar” with grins.  
The captain poured me a measure of watered wine and spoke of opening a guild when we reached land.  
For the first time since leaving Bonona, I felt not like a stowaway but like a teacher again.
