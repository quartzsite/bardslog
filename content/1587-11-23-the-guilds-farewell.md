The morning after Merryen passed, the bells tolled low and long. The guildmasters and students gathered in the courtyard beneath a grey sky, each wearing their best doublets and their swords at their sides.  

Master Merryen's coffin, draped in cloth embroidered with the guild's emblem, was carried by four of his senior pupils. As they walked, the men and women of the guild saluted with their blades.  

The salute was not a flourish but a sequence of cuts: Zornhau, Krumphau, Zwerchhau, Schielhau, Scheitelhau â€” the master strikes he had taught us, each performed slowly, deliberately, like prayers.  

I stood at the front with my lute. When the coffin reached the center of the yard, I began to play. The melody was one he loved, a song of river journeys and returning home. The notes mingled with the whisper of steel.  

There were tears, and there were set jaws. We buried him in a corner of the yard beneath a young oak. We each placed our right hand on the earth above him, swearing to honour the art he had shared with us.  

Honouring the fallen honours the art. The courtyard felt emptier, but the sound of our salutes lingered in the air, a promise to carry his lessons onward.
