The days blurred into one another as I stayed in Strasbourg, and yet each brought a new lesson.  \
After the dussack and halberd, Master Merryen placed a rapier in my hand and told me to forget everything and remember it all.  \
"This is neither broadsword nor lute," he said. "It is a line."  \
He taught me how to draw that line through the air, how to extend my arm from the shoulder, how to let the point speak before the edge.  \
Then he had me cut with it, slashing with the false edge and true, recovering to the thrust like a refrain.  \
We fenced with partners, exploring the tension between cut and thrustâ€”how a feint could open a line, how a quick cut could force a guard, how a thrust could end a verse.  \
Around us the Fechtschule buzzed with other students: burghers' sons, mercenaries, a curious nun.  \
We traded techniques like musicians trading melodies.  \
In the evenings I wrote down what I had learned, my notes looking like a songbook full of staves and strikes.  \
I began to understand that every weapon has both edge and point, and that the art lies in knowing which to show and which to hide.
