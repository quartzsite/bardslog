Master Merryen's lessons did not stop at swords.  \
He placed a poleaxe into my hands and told me to become taller, wider, more aware.  \
We drilled cuts and thrusts against wooden posts, learning to let the haft slide through our palms, to strike with the hammer, the spike, the axe.  \
When my shoulders burned he had me take up a pike twice my height and walk the length of the hall, feeling its weight, its balance, its unwieldy grace.  \
"You must imagine men beside you," he said, "a wall of steel and ash.  \
You are not alone when you hold this."  \
So I closed my eyes and saw fields I had only ever sung about: the banks of the Rhine, the hills of Swabia, the dusty squares of the Levant.  \
I imagined ranks of footmen, the push of pikes, the crash of cavalry, the scent of damp earth and powder.  \
In those visions I saw how each movement fit into a greater pattern, how the drills in the Fechtschule were fragments of a living tapestry.  \
These exercises were not just about my own skill but about the bodies that would stand with me.  \
By the end of the week I moved with a confidence I had not felt as a singer.  \
My songs were still within me, but now they were joined by visions of battle, and I knew that I would only grow stronger under Master Merryen's tutelage.
