# Stremaçone and Molinero  
**1587-12-27**  
*Sala d'Armi, Bonona*

Maros set a sidesword in my hand and traced a diagonal on the chalk star. The *stremaçone* began high and fell through a circle that landed me in guard on the opposite low. Hips turned. Shoulders followed. The blade drew its own path if I let the wrist stay quiet. On the star I stepped from point to point, breath steady, recover clean.

Then he taught the *molinero*. The blade milled around the hand in smooth rotation. Not hacking. Not carving. A wheel that kept my edge awake while my intent stayed hidden. I felt the weight pass like water from finger to finger. The curtain formed without stiffness. When I tested distance the circle stole space, then gave it back on my terms.

Sweat gathered. Shoulders burned. The rhythm settled. Downbeat for the *stremaçone*, upbeat for the recover, the *molinero* turning between like a drumroll. Maros touched my elbow and the angle sharpened. He moved my foot a finger’s width and the line appeared. “Let the circle lie,” he said. “When they reach for it, show the straight.”

I left the hall with a wheel still spinning in my hands and the sense that circles are honest only until you need them to lie.
