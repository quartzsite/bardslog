Master Maros wasted no time after my first lesson.  He placed a sidesword in my hand and taught me the stremaçone, a descending cut that seemed to carve a circle through the air.  Each blow began high on one side and ended low on the opposite, returning to guard in a single breath.  The motion was less like chopping wood and more like letting a stone fall in a perfect arc.  On the eight‑pointed star I moved from one point to the opposite diagonal, letting my hips turn fluidly.  

Then he showed me the molinero.  I had heard the word in old tavern songs but never knew its meaning.  It was a series of circular cuts, a milling of the blade around the hand, turning wrist and forearm like a waterwheel.  At first I thought of the Zwerchhau and Krumphau I had learned from the hermit – cuts that break guards.  The molinero served a different purpose: it created a curtain of steel that hid my intentions and controlled the opponent's measure.  Maros told me to feel the blade’s weight as it circled, to imagine stirring a pot rather than hacking at an enemy.  The circles were continuous and elegant, each rotation feeding into the next.  

As I practised, sweat gathered at my brow and my shoulders burned, but there was a meditative quality in the rotation.  The stremaçone and molinero felt like music: downbeat and up‑beat, heavy and light.  Maros moved around me, correcting the angle of my elbow or the placement of my foot on the star.  “Remember,” he said, “circular cuts can deceive and control.  Your opponent will see a wheel and not know where the spoke will strike.”  I left the sala that day feeling both humbled and invigorated, with new circles spinning in my mind.
