They kept him behind a paling of warped timbers, the kind used for mantlets when coin is thin—wide gaps, no trust in them. The foreman called him **the engineer** and would not use his name. His hands were free enough to sketch in dust, but a chain ran from ankle to a post sunk through an old millstone. That detail told me everything: they prized his work and feared his leaving.

Sura walked the yard like a quiet audit. She counted carts, coil by coil of hemp, the iron dogs for binding beams. *Count first, cut last*—our newer rule held even where there were no swords. When the foreman laughed at her questions, she switched to the Guild tongue. That sobered him. By noon we had the charter on a table: **Articles of the Masons and Engines**, with its moth-chewed clause that a craftsman may claim **Relief for Rescue** if his labor is bent toward cruelty against the commons.

The engineer had the look of a man who had tried to grow old too quickly and failed—ink at the nails, a squint that measured angles in people as in stone. On the ground he had drawn a frame that could be carried by four and braced by two: a folding stair with kite-spars for ribs and lashings at the joints. “Goes up under fire,” he said without greeting, “or down a wall in rain. You choose the direction by the first count.”

“Your name?” Sura asked.

He hesitated, then: “Perkin.”

I thought of the gallows that gave the road its name. The posts were still there, cut short and pressed into service as bollards, a thrift that felt like a curse. We stood by them while the foreman argued that the lord’s bond outweighed any guild paper. Sura marked the signatures, the seal that had never been renewed, the witness who had since been proscribed. I played scribe and fool by turns, drawing his heat while she set the snare.

Perkin watched us as a sapper watches a wall. “If you cut me loose,” he said, “know what you take. I make things that open—gates, ranks, water, men. Opening doesn’t ask what for.”

“We will,” I answered, “and we’ll ask twice.” I told him what we meant to open: not towns for plunder but corridors for escape, docks for grain, rooms where hostages could breathe. Work of rescue. Not reprisal.

He nodded once, almost a bow. “Then you will need weight where wind thinks it wins.” He tapped the folded stair. “Kitebone,” he said—Sura’s road-name made wood. “Light, but it catches what pushes. For walls, for boats pulled against a tide, for roofs that want to fall in.”

The foreman tried threat, then price. Sura stayed with the charter and the law of lapse. In the end he reached for a cudgel of custom—“This is how it’s always been”—and found only his own hand. The yardmen had listened while Perkin spoke of roofs and floodgates; some had families under such roofs. The chain came off with a key nobody had seen fit to hide.

Perkin did not thank us, not aloud. He lifted the millstone with two others, set it on edge, and chalked a circle across its face—true, centered, clean. “Your compass is wrong,” he told me gently. “The small globe lies. The big globe is water.”

We walked out with him carrying nothing but a roll of oilcloth and a bag of iron pins. On the road he asked for our count—hands, places to sleep, who owed us and who we owed. I gave the numbers and the names. He listened, then began to speak in measures: spans for ladders, the pitch of rope over wet wood, the distance a man can run with a child on his back before breath breaks.

That night he drew by lantern on the back of a broadsheet: not a map, yet. A language of squares and winds and little triangles like teeth. He wrote no place names, only forces, and underlined one word: **open**.

Sura smiled at that. “Unbound suits you,” she said.

Perkin blew the chalk from his fingers. “Only if you keep counting.”
