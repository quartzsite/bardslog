I awoke on a strand of pebbles and salt, the waves having thrown me like driftwood onto a shore I did not know. My hands were still wrapped around the plank that had kept me alive. Seaweed clung to my hair, and my limbs shook with cold.  
  
A shadow fell across me. A man stood there with a grin, his hair tied back and a sabre at his side. "Bonona even sends its lads by sea now?" he said. His accent was differentâ€”rounder, rougher. He offered me a hand and a crust of bread. I learned his name was Master Carlen Rowen of Lynden.  
  
Rowen chuckled at my tale. He mocked the "high-society twirlers" of Bonona, calling them perfumed peacocks. Yet there was kindness behind the teasing. He wrapped me in a cloak and led me to a small cottage overlooking the grey-green water. As we walked, he spoke with pride about the Empire and the free cities that kept its edges sharp. In his mind, Bonona's grace was weakness; Maraisbourg's guilds, he insisted, should have taken the capital long ago.  
  
I said little. My body was too tired and my mind too tangled with what I had heard in Bonona. But I felt the warmth of the fire Rowen lit and the welcome of the stew he set before me. I had drifted to a new shore, and a new master had found me.
