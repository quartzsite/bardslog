I woke to stone under my ribs and the sea picking my pockets. The beach was more teeth than sand, black lava chewed into flats and knives. I spat brine, counted to five, and only reached four.

“Osric!” I tried again, softer. Wind carries fear better than orders.

A cough answered from the wrack line. Then Rell’s whistle—two short, one long—the deck signal for _alive but pinned_. I rolled to my knees and found a length of sprung oar: ash, good flex, iron cuff still fixed. A spear if I asked it to be.

I took stock. No sword, no sideknife, just a fractured scabbard riding my thigh like a joke. I put the scabbard away in my head and did the work.

**Count first.** Bodies: four moving—Osric Talledger listing like a shot cask, Elowen Rell tangled in net, Ivor Blackmere face-down but grumbling at the surf for salting his stew. One more shape too-still farther down the cove; not ours. The Trader had been running light—half crew sent ahead with the grain—luck, not design.

“Rell, don’t fight it,” I said, stepping the oar between net and rock, easing lines off her shoulders. “Let the wave lift, I’ll pull on the fall.” We rode the heave together; the net let go with a bark of tarred twine.

She sat up, hair full of kelp. “Aye, Sergeant,” she said out of habit. I corrected her with a hand. “Boatswain,” I said. “Ship’s gone. Titles stay.”

Osric had a ledger even here—oilskin packet lashed under his shirt. Of course he did. He coughed pink once, then clear. “Count?” he asked, because he knew me.

“Four,” I said. “You can make it five if you insist.”

Ivor rolled over, spat a crab leg, and lifted a length of deck grating. “Found the pantry,” he said, meaning the sea had delivered wood. His grin was cracked porcelain, but it was a grin.

We set a triangle of jobs before noon.

**Watch.** Two hours on, two off, eyes to the reef cut where the rip ran meanest. We wanted wreckage, not raiders.

**Water.** Rell took the high ridge to read the island’s slope; where the green thickened, there would be a trickle. She carried a coil of recovered line and a fish spine as a hook, because that’s what she does—makes something out of a nothing.

**Fire.** Ivor muttered about kindling the size of pea-coals and set a ring of stones where the wind bent least. No blaze: signal smoke brings help or knives, and we had not yet decided which we were asking for.

I took **tools**. The oar gave me reach; a shattered yard gave me haft. With Osric’s belt iron and a shard of the Trader’s broken pump, I bound a spearhead the length of my hand. Ugly, sure, but it would go through fish, or a man if the math said so.

Osric squinted at the shoals and started counting out loud, because numbers keep a man upright. “Barrels?” he asked.

“Drift out beyond the teeth,” I said. “We’ll fetch what the sea gives when the tide turns.”

“Ledger says we owed Perin & Sons nine casks by month’s end,” he said, which was Osric for _we are not finished just because we’ve nearly died_.

Rell returned with her hands wet and her boots caked with lime. “Trickle behind the ferns,” she said. “Sweet enough, but slow as pension pay. We’ll need a catch to argue with thirst.”

“Then nets first, knives later,” I said. “We fish with brains before we hunt with steel.”

That made Ivor snort. “That’s a cook’s line, Master Strake.”

“It’s a ship’s line,” I said. “Steel is last resort. Count first, cut last.”

We marked the too-still body downshore with a cairn of three stones, neat and clean. We didn’t go rifling; the sea had already done that. If I ever meet a man who was saved by what he took off the dead, I’ll ask him who tallied the interest.

By dusk we had a lean-to that didn’t leak and a fire that was more heat than smoke. I stood the first watch with the spear and the oar both, because I didn’t trust one story at a time. The reef talked in two voices—the crash and the undertow—and both sounded like arguments I’d had with petty officers.

Osric fussed with his ledger in the fire’s orange edge, writing the unwriteable: _four souls, one spear, forty fathoms line, nine hooks imagined_. He looked up. “Do we signal tonight?”

“Not until we can pay for the answer,” I said. “A flag calls, but it doesn’t choose.”

Rell lay on her side, hands as pillows, listening to the wind. “It shifts after midnight,” she said. “You can hear it pull off the ridge and come back slower. That’s a chance to run a float.”

“We don’t have floats,” I said.

She tapped the wreck grating with her boot. “We do now.”

That’s how it went. Not heroic, not glorious—just correct. The kind of correctness that keeps blood inside skin.

Near moonrise a half barrel rode the rip in, bumping the teeth once, twice, then sliding into our reach. Osric and I went knee-deep to hook it and pull. It was No. 5 of Perin & Sons by the stamp, leak-plugged with seaweed. Inside: three sodden sacks of barley and a smell like the Trader’s last prayer.

Ivor grinned wider. “Stew,” he said, reverent.

“Porridge,” I corrected. “Stew tomorrow, when we know we can afford salt.”

Rell slept between breaths, the way lines sleep on a calm deck—ready to take strain. I watched the reef. When I grew colder than cautious, I walked the beach to the cairn we had made and added a fourth stone. Not for counting. For weight against forgetting.

At second watch change, a shadow moved beyond the teeth, low and steady. Not barrel, not beam: hull. Small. I raised my spear and lowered it in the same motion, letting the oar show first—long, harmless, a fisherman’s silhouette.

Osric’s hand touched my elbow. “Math?” he whispered.

“We can feed four and hide in the daylight,” I said. “We can’t fight six and keep the water sweet.”

The hull turned away, uninterested, or too wise to test knife shore at night. I let my breath go. I didn’t call it mercy; I called it **accounting**. Same sum, different hymn.

Come dawn, I cut the scabbard free and burned it. A man should not carry the shape of a thing he doesn’t have. Then I drilled the morning words into the other three, because repetition is a kind of shelter.

“Count first—”

“—cut last,” they answered, even Ivor, who hates doctrine like he hates thin soup.

That was our beginning on Black Reef: one spear, one barrel, four souls, and a rule that tasted like flint. We’d add water, wind, and stone soon enough, but the first element was number.

And number kept us.
