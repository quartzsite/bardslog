# Arguing the Sun  
**1588-02-04**  
*Driftwood Fire, Black Reef | Osric Talledger (quartermaster)*

We set the pot on three stones and kept the fire low so the smoke rose clean. Salt water ticked in the driftwood like a clock. I opened my ledger on my knees. The ink would not take, so I scored the page with a nail.

Garran pointed at the sunset and said **west is there**. Rell shook her head and traced the long-set swell with her palm. **Wind says otherwise**. Ivor tasted the air, then the broth, and said **home is where the food will not kill us**. I wrote the three claims in a column and drew lines between them until the page looked like netting.

We used to have a captain for this. Vess would bark a heading and take the blame if it failed. We made him walk for selling us to a storm. Now the blame is ours and the heading too.

I counted what we had. Rope cured yesterday. Two sound spars. Seal hide enough for one good sail if we cut the coats. A tide that turns at third bell. Birds leaving at dawn along a steady line. I drew a second column and wrote **means** on top.

Rell marked sand with a bit of char. She drew the island, the reef teeth, and the run of the waves. **Follow birds at first light. Ride the line to cleaner water.** Garran said **hug the coast west**. Ivor said **take the channel you can survive**. I said **choose the tide that forgives mistakes**.

We argued until the pot went to silence. Then we set a rule because we had no captain to set one for us.

- count first, cut last  
- choose weather over pride  
- if the sea says no, we say later

We slept in shifts. At dawn we will launch. The sun will tell us where west lies. The wind and the swell may carry us east. If it does, we will call that **home for now** and live long enough to make the name true.
