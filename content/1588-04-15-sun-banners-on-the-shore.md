We reached the lee of a long sand spit at noon. The red smear became tiled roofs, then watch platforms, then banners with a sun that looked carved from lacquer. A bell on shore counted three beats. We answered with the small drum that had seen us through the squalls. Osric set the anchor by feel and did not look at me. Garran wrapped the tiller rope twice and breathed once.

Two boats came out from the jetty. Their oars lifted together and set together. The men in them wore coats the color of clay and straw hats wide as shields. No blades showed. That was the first courtesy.

I stood where they could see my hands. S I N G in the chest. Set stance in a boat is heels to the plank and spine to the mast. Intend the outcome is safe water and fair trade. Notice measure is two hull lengths and the angle of their bows. Give grace is a greeting in the language we had learned from scrap pages and lantern talk.

They hailed us with words I half knew. I answered with the same four words and let Wind and Water carry the rest. A woman in the bow of the nearer boat raised her palm. I raised mine. She pointed to their jetty and traced a small circle in the air. Stone in me agreed. We would follow.

On the jetty they waited with a writing board and a bowl of fresh water. We wrote the name of our boat, the count of our crew, and the purpose of our landfall. The woman touched the board with a brush and drew a small sun beside the word trade. She smiled the way a teacher does when a pupil gets the form right.

Flame wanted to speak about the wreck and the dead. I let it cool. There would be time. Today was arrival, not reckoning.

We were led past storehouses and wind chimes to a yard with a chalked circle and a wooden star set in the dust. I stepped to its edge without thinking and saw her note it. She said a word that sounded like keeper and then spoke the name of a house that watched the sea. Pagoda-Keepers. A bell rang again, once. The day bent in our favor.

A child ran past with a folded paper and vanished up a ladder toward a tall roof. Maps have rooms, I thought. Rooms have doors. Doors open.

When the sun cut low the same boats escorted us back to our mooring. The woman gave us a small flag with the jetty mark and showed where to tie it. Courtesy upon courtesy. We slept with the anchor rope in our hands and the shore lights steady as stars.
