# Shipwreck of the Westward Trader  
**1588-02-01**  
*Black Reef, Distant Isles — Garran Strake (master-at-arms)*

Stone under my ribs. The sea picking my pockets. I spat brine, counted to five, and only reached four.

“Osric!”—too loud. Wind carries fear better than orders. A cough from the wrack line answered, then Rell’s whistle—two short, one long—_alive but pinned_. I found a sprung oar—ash, good flex, iron cuff—more spear than paddle today.

**Count first.** Four moving: Osric Talledger with his ledger still lashed under his shirt; Elowen “Rell” Rell tangled in net; Ivor Blackmere face-down but cursing the surf for salting his stew; and me. One more shape downshore, too still—_not ours_. The Trader had sailed light; luck for once.

Rell stopped fighting as I levered the net. We rode the heave; tarred twine barked, let go. “Aye, Sergeant,” she said by habit. I corrected her with a hand. “Boatswain. Ship’s gone. Titles stay.”

Osric squinted through salt. “Count?” he asked.

“Four,” I said. “Make it five if you insist.” He grinned around a cough and patted the oilskin: an accountant rescuing numbers from a sinking world.

Ivor brandished a section of deck grating. “Found the pantry,” he said—meaning wood. His smile was cracked porcelain but serviceable.

We set three jobs before noon.

- **Watch.** Two hours on, two off, eyes to the rip where the reef’s teeth bit hardest. Wreckage, not raiders.
- **Water.** Rell took a ridge—line coiled, fish spine for a hook. Where the green thickened, a trickle would argue with thirst.
- **Fire.** Ivor nursed heat without smoke; signals invite answers you can’t afford.

I took **tools**. A shattered yard gave me haft, a pump shard edge. With Osric’s belt iron I bound a spearhead big as my hand—ugly, honest. It would go through fish. Through a man if the math said so.

By dusk we’d raised a lean-to that didn’t leak and a fire more heat than talk. The surf argued in two voices—crash and undertow—and I liked neither. Osric wrote the unwriteable at the fire’s edge: _four souls, one spear, forty fathoms line, nine hooks imagined_. “Do we signal?” he asked.

“Not till we can pay for the answer,” I said. “A flag calls, but it doesn’t choose.”

Rell returned, hands wet, boots limed. “Trickle behind fern,” she reported. “Sweet, slow. We need a catch to argue with it.”  
“Then nets first, knives later,” I said. “Fish with brains before hunt with steel.” Even Ivor nodded.

We built a neat cairn for the too-still man downshore—three stones. We didn’t rifle. If I ever meet a man who lived on what he took off the dead, I’ll ask him who tallied the interest.

Near moonrise a half barrel rode the rip, kissed the teeth twice, slid into reach. No. 5 by Perin & Sons’ stamp, leak-plugged with seaweed. Inside: three sodden sacks of barley and the Trader’s last prayer.  
“Stew,” Ivor breathed.  
“Porridge,” I corrected. “Stew when we can afford salt.”

Second watch, a shadow—low, steady—beyond the teeth. Not barrel, not beam: hull. I let the oar show first, long and harmless. The shadow turned away. I didn’t call it mercy. I called it **accounting**.

At dawn I cut the empty scabbard free and burned it. A man shouldn’t carry the shape of a thing he doesn’t have. Then I drilled the morning words, because repetition is shelter.

“Count first—”  
“—cut last,” they answered.

That was our beginning on Black Reef: one spear, one barrel, four souls, and a rule that tasted like flint. We’d add water, wind, and stone soon enough. But number came first.
