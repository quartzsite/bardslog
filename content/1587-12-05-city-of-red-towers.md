After weeks of travel, the road opened onto a plain where a city of red towers and colonnades rose against the winter sky.

Bonona was unlike any town I had seen: arcaded streets with merchants crying spices and parchment, students arguing philosophy beneath the porticoes, the sweet smoke of roasting chestnuts drifting from tavern doors. Its walls were old and thick, and its streets wound like the measures of a practiced dance.

Everywhere I looked, men and women wore slender side-swords as naturally as lutes across shoulders. The cityâ€™s energy was not the brashness of Maraisbourg but an elegant order, as if each step had been choreographed long ago.

As I passed through the gate, footsore and salt-stiff from the road, I felt both a stranger and a player in a larger performance. The dance of Bonona would teach me steps my earlier masters could not.
