After weeks of travel, the road finally opened onto a plain where a city of red towers and colonnades rose against the winter sky.  
Bonona was unlike any town I had ever seen: arcaded streets lined with merchants selling spices and parchment, students arguing about philosophy under porticoes, and the sweet smell of roasting chestnuts and strong coffee drifting from tavern doors.  
Its walls were old and thick, and its streets seemed to twist like the measures of a well-practised dance.  
Everywhere I looked, men and women carried slender sideâ€‘swords at their belts as naturally as lute strings over shoulders.  
The city's energy was not the brashness of Maraisbourg but a kind of elegant order, as if every step and gesture had been choreographed long ago.  
As I passed through the gate, I felt both a stranger and a participant in a larger performance.  
I knew that the dance of Bonona would teach me steps my earlier masters could not.
