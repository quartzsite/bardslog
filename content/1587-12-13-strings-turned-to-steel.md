The plains beyond the mountains were open and empty, the wind carrying only the rustle of dry grasses and the creak of my travel-weary lute.  
I had thought the worst of the journey behind me until riders appeared on the horizon, their intent as clear as their drawn swords.  
With no branch or staff nearby, I felt for the neck of my instrument and remembered the long, straight thrusts Merryen taught with the rapier.  

When the first attacker closed in, I stepped aside and extended the lute like a blade, striking his wrist with the tuning pegs.  
He cried out more in surprise than in pain, dropping his weapon.  
The others hesitated, unsure whether to laugh or flee; their delay was all I needed.  
I used the lute to parry a slash, twisting my body as if in a dance, then thrust the instrument's head towards another chest, forcing him back.  

In that moment I realized that my art and my new craft were not separate paths but intertwined strings of the same song.  
A bard's gift is not only in soothing hearts but in turning anything at hand into a tool for survival.  
When the riders finally rode off, muttering of mad minstrels, I smiled and retuned the pegs.  
The road ahead was long, but my music would protect me as surely as steel.
