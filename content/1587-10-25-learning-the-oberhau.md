Dawn broke through the trees and found me already awake, fingers itching not for strings but for a length of ash that the hermit handed me.  
He called the first strike the "over‑hew," a descending cut that travels from high to low like the beginning of a song. It was nothing like swinging a lute — it demanded that I turn my hips, align my shoulders, and let gravity do the work.  
We stepped through it slowly, again and again, until my muscles began to remember. He struck at me with a branch and I learned to meet his blow at the center line, to maintain my measure and not overreach.  
"This is not about strength," he said, "but about structure. The Oberhau is the mother of all strikes. If you can play this note true, the rest will follow."  
In between repetitions he spoke of old Fechtbucher and masters whose names the world had forgotten. He would not admit it, but I know the verse of Grandmaster von Leichtnauer when I hear it.  
My arms ache as I write this, yet there is a calm in my mind that I've never felt after applause.
