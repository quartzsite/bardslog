The day after he found me, Rowen took me walking inland. The island's scrub and stone gave way to a hamlet built from pale timber, with nets drying on racks and children chasing chickens. "This is Lynden," he said, "though some call it a backwater. It suits me."  
  
He sat me on a log outside his shed and poured me ale that tasted of apples and smoke. "Tell me again why you left Bonona," he said. I told him of whispers in a tavern, of venom in a cup and a duke with plans. His brow furrowed and he spat into the dirt. "Those courtly fencers think politics is a duel. But when cities start scheming against the Empire, it's the farmers and fishermen who bleed."  
  
Rowen spoke of Maraisbourg and the free cities. He said they should have taken the capital and freed the Empire from what he called "soft hands and silk doublets." He laughed at the idea of grace for its own sake. "We fight to keep folk free, not to look pretty."  
  
Still, he listened when I spoke of Master Maros's eight-pointed star and the way the blade could sing. He nodded, begrudgingly admitting there was value in poise. "We'll teach each other," he said finally. "You show me your star; I'll show you how to cut through a boar's spine."  
  
We shook on it. In that moment I felt the weight of all my masters behind me—von Lychenar's discipline, Merryen's ambition, Maros's grace—and the rough humour of Rowen before me. It seemed the path would only grow stranger.
