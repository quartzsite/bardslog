In the quiet between classes I set my lute on a table and began to give names to what we were doing. Not guards, not catalogues of cuts, but **voices**—ways the body speaks through steel. A name is a memory peg; a student who remembers the word can recall the feeling.

**The Voice of Wind — agility, grace, avoidance.**  
We drilled slipping steps on the eight-pointed star: advance on the forward ray, vanish on the diagonal, let the cut pass where you used to be. The blade was light in the hand, the shoulder soft, the wrist alive. When the partner struck, we answered not with force but with absence and a touch on the return.

**The Voice of Stone — grounding, stance, resolve.**  
I set a mug on the floor and told them to cut without moving it. Heels kissed, knees bent, hip turning under the ribcage—weight settled like a pillar sunk deep. The edge aligned of its own accord when the feet were honest. “Stone does not chase,” I said. “It receives, it turns, it stands.”

**The Voice of Flame — passion, tempo, spirit.**  
The drum sounded quick counts. We worked broken rhythms: one-two—_and_—four; hold on three and strike through the breath. Flame was not frenzy but **timing**—the choice to spend courage in an instant. The sabreman laughed aloud here; even the monk grinned when the room began to move as one.

**The Voice of Water — flow, adaptability, yielding.**  
I had them chain parry into parry, cut into thrust into cut, never halting the circle of the core. We let the partner’s pressure teach the next motion. When the edge met resistance we slid to the flat, when the line was closed we took another—no stubbornness, only the path that remained.

Each voice was a **cut**, a **note**, a **virtue**.  
Wind was the high string; Stone the drone beneath; Flame the sudden strike that lifts the chorus; Water the phrase that carries us back to quiet. We drilled to a single drumbeat until the line between fencing and dancing thinned to a thread.

By lamplight I wrote the names into the book the monk was illuminating, his hand sketching stars and arcs around my verse. I closed the page with the sentence I wanted them to hear in their bones:

**To strike is to sing; to sing is to remember.**
