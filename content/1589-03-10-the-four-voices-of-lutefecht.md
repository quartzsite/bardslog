Faelar codified the new art. He spoke of four voices: the Voice of Wind — agility, grace, avoidance; the Voice of Stone — grounding, stance, resolve; the Voice of Flame — passion, tempo, spirit; the Voice of Water — flow, adaptability, yielding.  
Each voice corresponded to a cut, a note, a virtue. Students drilled to the sound of a single drumbeat. The line between fencing and dancing dissolved.  
"To strike is to sing. To sing is to remember."
