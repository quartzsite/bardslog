Sura drew two lines in chalk on the sluicehouse door.

One she marked in red wax from a seal I’d carried since the Guild-hall—straight through the center, past the bell, past the guard cot, to the lock on the press pen. **Way of Death.** Clean, direct, loud.

The other she traced in carpenter’s blue: along the wallwalk, down the mill stairs, under the wheel, through the wicket at the river-winch. **Gate of Mercy.** Longer, quieter, built instead of broken.

“Count first,” she said, tapping each turn. “Then decide which door we open.”

Perkin stood in the doorway, listening to the water hammer against the paddles. He had already counted—eight men in the yard, two under the awning with the bell-rope, one asleep by the sluice ratchet. He sketched with a coal nub on a board: not streets and houses, but **forces**—arrows for flow, squares for weight, a circle for the bell. At the wicket he drew a triangle and wrote **OPEN** beside it.

“Your red line works,” he said. “It will cost noise and blood and still leave the wheel turning. The blue line stops the wheel, opens water enough to float the boats, and empties the pen when the yard goes to save the grain.” He set his coal on the table. “Both are ways. Choose.”

We had found the press-yard by rumor and whistle. Farmers called it a levy for river-work; the men inside called it **the funnel**. The sluice kept their skiffs beached until the lord’s foreman needed hands. When the water rose and the chain came off, a dozen would be sent out **with** a guard and half would not return.

Sura made me repeat the numbers back: nine guards, two dogs, one bell, one gate-chain, three keys. Rope: four coils. Pins: twenty-one. Men inside: seventeen. Boys: three. One old man with a cough like dry bark.

“Way of Death,” I said, because that path was in my muscles from other halls with other bells. “Fast, before they wake.”

“Gate of Mercy,” she answered, because we had written it into our book and because the next page after ink is proof.

Perkin nodded once and set to work. He showed me how to choke the mill-wheel with two pins and a wedge called a **butcher’s blessing**—named for turning force aside without breaking the bone. He made Sura feel the play in the sluice ratchet: three clicks heavy, one light, then the fall. He tied the dogs to a sack of barley and fed them until sleep took rank over duty.

We moved on counts, not courage. I ruined the bell with wax in the clapper and a strip of felt; if it rang, it would ring like a small sorrow. Sura took the keys from a guard who woke, saw her eyes, and decided—by some private arithmetic—that the river had more of him than the yard. Perkin waited by the ratchet, breathing with the wheel as if it were a stubborn ox.

When the last guard turned to the cook-pot, Sura gave me two fingers. I set the wedge. Perkin took the ratchet up one click, then another, then **past** the light one. The river swelled like a held breath and then exhaled. The beached skiffs lifted, bellies scraping free. In the press pen, men who had learned not to hope stood when the mud moved under them.

“Gate of Mercy,” Sura whispered, almost smiling. “Go.”

We did not draw steel until a man raised a pike at a boy’s back. Then I cut—once—through the ash-wood haft, not the wrist. The flat against his ribs put him down. It was a small correction to the red line, a note in the margin: **cut last, and then not flesh**.

The yard boiled to the sluice, as Perkin had promised. Grain sacks toppled; the foreman chose to save them and cursed us for forcing him to care about food. We opened the pen and the wicket and the skiffs together. Seventeen, then twenty, then all but the coughing elder were **through**. The old man could not climb; Perkin made a step with the kitebone stair—two ribs, one lash, an instant ladder—and lifted him as if he were measure instead of weight.

The only thing we left broken was the habit that only one door ever opens.

On the road beyond the reeds, the freed men waited for us to say what would happen **next**. Sura counted them again—hands, ages, debts—and did something I had not seen her do in public: she read from our little book.

> **Rule:** *Way of Death remains open in all places; it will always be there.*  
> **Counter-Rule:** *Build and prefer a Gate of Mercy wherever force can be turned to passage.*  
> **Method:** *Count first; cut last. If cutting must be done, cut wood, rope, signal, wheel—before you cut a person.*

Perkin added his own line with coal: **Stop what pushes. Open where pressure wants.**

We walked back along the towpath in silence. Behind us, the foreman was shouting about theft and vows. Ahead, the men we’d freed were naming boats after daughters and saints and the moon. Sura looked at the river and said, “The next page is people, not locks.”

“Five by choice,” I said, thinking of the faces I had watched when the gate swung. The ones who moved toward the others with coats and water. The ones who kept count without being asked.

Perkin held the board with his map of forces up to the lamplight. Where he had written **OPEN**, he drew three short strokes like rays and then a small door-frame. “A gate,” he said softly, as if surprised to see the thing he had made himself say.

I tuned my lute at the mile-stone and played a slow measure that kept step with the tow horses. The tune found its center not on the strike but on the **pause** between notes.

Way of Death is a road. We all know how to walk it.

Tonight we learned to build a door beside it.
