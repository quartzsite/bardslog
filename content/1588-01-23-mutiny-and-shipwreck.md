The tension that had simmered beneath decks finally boiled over.  \n
Food and water were nearly gone, and the captain's ledger was the only thing fatter than our bellies.  \n
A knot of men confronted him at dusk, voices raised and hands on hilts.  \n
I saw in their eyes the same fear I had used to cut through in training, but there was no drill for hunger.  \n
They seized the captain, bound his hands and made him walk the plank as the sun bled into the sea.  \n
He saluted me before he fell, reminding me of our promise to open a guild, and vanished beneath the waves.  \n
With the most seasoned sailor gone, the mutineers argued over charts and currents.  \n
They scoffed at my caution and steered us toward a bank of dark clouds, believing a faster route lay through the heart of the storm.  \n
When the squall hit, it was like facing a giant with nothing but a stick.  \n
Masts splintered, sails tore, and the deck bucked as if trying to throw us into the deep.  \n
Men who had called me Master clung to rigging and prayed.  \n
In the end the ship broke apart on unseen rocks.  \n
I grabbed a plank and held on as the sea claimed the Westward Trader and those who had mutinied.  \n
The storm tossed me like a leaf and somewhere between wave and wind I thought of the eightâ€‘pointed star, turning endlessly, and of the masters whose lessons had carried me this far.  \n
The promise of a guild sank with the captain, but I was still afloat.  \n
Where the current would take me I did not know, but I sensed land ahead and a new chapter on the horizon.  \n
