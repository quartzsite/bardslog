The tension that had simmered below decks finally boiled over. Food and water were nearly gone, and the captain’s ledger seemed the only thing fatter than our bellies. At dusk a knot of men confronted him, voices raised, hands on hilts. I knew the fear in their eyes; I had cut through it in training—but there is no drill for hunger.

They seized the captain, bound his hands, and made him walk the plank as the sun bled into the sea. He saluted me before he fell, reminding me of our promise to found a guild, and vanished beneath the waves.

With the most seasoned sailor gone, the mutineers argued over charts and currents. They scoffed at my caution and steered us toward a wall of dark cloud, believing a faster route lay through the heart of the storm.

When the squall struck, it was like facing a giant with a stick. Masts splintered; sails tore; the deck bucked to fling us into the deep. Men who had called me Master clung to the rigging and prayed. In the end the ship broke apart on unseen rocks.

I caught a floating plank and held fast as the sea claimed the *Westward Trader* and those who had mutinied. The storm tossed me like a leaf. Somewhere between wave and wind I thought of the eight-pointed star, turning endlessly, and of the masters whose lessons had borne me this far.

The promise of a guild sank with the captain, but I remained afloat. Where the current would cast me I did not know—only that land lay somewhere ahead, and a new chapter waited on its shore.
