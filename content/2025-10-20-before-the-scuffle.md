I, Faelar Brightnote, have always been a bard. My lute has been my companion from the great fairs of the northern marches to the sun baked courts near the Inner Sea. I learned the ballads of old and kept alive the stories of the kingdoms and republics that dot this patchwork of realms that scholars of the old world might know as sixteenth‑century Europe and the Mediterranean, though here we give them other names.  

Yet lately my voice feels small. The patrons of The Smoky Hearth demand bawdy tavern tunes and pay in copper when the songs are done. The merchants haggle over the price of art as though it were salt or wool. The city lords worry about wars of religion and succession, treaties between guilds and princes, but the artists who keep their tales alive are left to starve. In the ports of Bonona the fleetmasters argue over who will control the seas against the Sultan of the South; in the courts of Lynden the talk is of mercenaries and pike squares; across the mountains in the Free Cities of the Upper Rhine there are whispers of reformers and emperors. I know these names because I am a storyteller; my duty is to remember.  

Still, I feel adrift. My songs have not carried me where I hoped. The great masters of arms—Grandmaster von Leichtnauer, whose verses on the sword have guided warriors for generations; Master Merryen of Strasbourg, who paints the geometry of cuts like a poet; Master Aquil Maros of Bonona, whose fencing in the winding streets rivals the duellists of the lagoon; Master Carlen Rowen of Lynden, who trains sailors to fight on deck—are all spoken of with reverence. Me? I am the nobody who sings their praises, not someone whose deeds are sung.  

Tonight I write by the fire with a weariness on my heart. I have been a wandering minstrel long enough to know the price of a warm bed and a stale loaf. I feel like I am moving in circles. The wars and courts I describe change men’s fortunes, but not mine. Perhaps I am too gentle, too accommodating, too afraid to wield anything but words. Perhaps there is another path, if I could only hear it above the din.
