He came at noon with the harbor wind in his cloak and old campaigns in his eyes. A veteran by the set of his shoulders, he shouldered through the tavern door and slammed a gauntlet on the table.

“You’re turning men soft,” he said. “Teaching dances where there should be steel.”

I told him the floor was for lessons, not for quarrels, and stepped into the street.

He followed—sword already half-drawn. A small crowd gathered: fishmongers, a pair of students, two sailors who had taken morning ale too seriously. I slipped my lute strap from my shoulder and set the instrument on my left forearm, the belly outward. It looked foolish enough to satisfy him.

“Name your measure,” I said.

“An arm’s length,” he growled, and came in hard.

I let **Stone** answer first: weight settled, edge aligned, the lute taking the slap meant for my hand. He pressed; I gave him **Wind**—a slant step along the star I had chalked a dozen times inside, letting his cut pass where I had been. He swung again, faster now, and I felt his breath shorten. **Water** carried my blade from parry to parry without halt; each time he met nothing but the ghost of my line.

He grew angry, which is to say predictable. The crowd’s murmur thickened.

When he drove a thrust for my heart, I let the lute’s rim catch his forte and turned it aside with a small circle. His point skated; our steel kissed; I rode the bind, slid along, and found the opening he had left in his own haste. **Flame** flickered—only a spark. I placed a thrust an inch from his breastbone and stopped.

Silence fell the way snow falls.

“Lutefecht,” I said, lowering the blade, “is for those who wish not to kill.”

His jaw worked; pride argued with sense. At last he dropped his sword into his palm and offered it, hilt first, in acknowledgment. The crowd exhaled. Someone laughed softly, not at him but at the release of breath we had all been holding.

He came at first light the next morning, cloak folded over his arm, eyes clearer than the day before.

“Teach me the steps,” he said.

We began with measure.
