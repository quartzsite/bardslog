A veteran soldier storms into the tavern, denouncing the guild for “turning men soft.”  
Faelar offers him a duel. They fight in the street — Faelar using a lute for a shield.  
The soldier tires; Faelar disarms him with a fluid thrust that stops an inch from his heart.  
He bows, saying, “Lutefecht is for those who wish not to kill.”  
The veteran joins them the next morning.
