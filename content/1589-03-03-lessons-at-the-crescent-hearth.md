The tavern became a school. They cleaned the floorboards, hung lanterns, and turned long tables into pell posts.  
Faelar taught not stances but principles: measure is harmony; tempo is breath; strike as if striking a chord.  
Each student came from a different tradition — longsword, sidesword, sabre — and each found rhythm in unity.  
Faelar began recording the lessons in verse, illuminated with diagrams drawn by the monk.
