By dawn we had turned ruin into room. We swept broken glass into a corner, planed splinters from the floorboards, and set the long tavern tables upright as if they were sturdy pells. The hearth coughed back to life; lanterns swung from ceiling hooks like slow pendulums marking time. A painted crescent hung above the bar, and in its dim light the faces that had wandered in, soldier, student, sailor, monk, began to look less like strangers and more like a class.

I told them we would not begin with stances. Stances are where one ends when one knows what one is doing. We would begin instead with principles.

**Measure is harmony.** I had them walk toward and away from one another without blades, hands at their sides. When they could stop on a breath before colliding, I let them hold wooden swords. No cuts, only the distance at which a single step would bring a true threat. Murmurs faded as they found the quiet between too far and too close.

**Tempo is breath.** I set my lute upon a chair, plucked a single note, and made them move to its length. Advance on the tone, retreat as it dies, recover in the silence. A mercenary scoffed; by the third round he was counting under his breath like any choirboy.

**Strike as if striking a chord.** When at last we cut, it was not to smash a pell but to sound a shape: shoulder to hip, elbow to wrist, edge aligned, body turning as if a wheel had caught them up. Those with longsword habits moved broad and brave. Those with the southern side sword curled their hands like quills. A sabreman from the western ferries carved air in crescents. Different tongues, one grammar.

Between drills I chalked a small eight pointed star on the tavern floor. The Bonona compass looked out of place among spilled ale stains, yet it steadied the room. I had them step point to point without crossing their feet, learning to let the floor carry the blade. When they stumbled, I told them to imagine sweeping ash from a hearth with the sole: light, certain, complete. The monk laughed and said we would polish the whole city at this rate.

There were questions about guards, about names, about whose master was right. I answered by showing how a simple slip of the front foot devours a rash attack; how a held breath ruins a thrust; how the point, low or high, means less than the will to recover it with grace. When tempers pricked, I paired the loudest voices and made them trade only parries for a count of fifty. They finished smiling, surprised at how much they had heard with their blades.

The lamp smoke stung and the room grew warm. We opened the shutters and let the sea wind in. I set my lute across my knee and sketched a few lines to catch the day before it escaped me, half verse, half diagram. The monk leaned over my shoulder, then fetched quill and ink of his own. His hand, steadier than mine, built illuminated letters around the figures, circles for measure, lines for step, a small star in the margin to remind us to move with purpose. He said a school should have a book; I told him a book should sing when opened.

By evening the tables were nicked and the students were bruised in honest places: forearms, shoulders, pride. We spoke little as we ate, but I saw how they sat straighter than they had that morning. Not soldiers, not courtiers, not guildsmen, just people who had learned to breathe together.

Before they left I said what I had meant to keep for later: we will call this Lutefecht. Not because the lute is a shield, nor because we fight with music, but because a song teaches you where to begin and where to end, and what to do with the silence between.

They nodded as if they had known the name all along. One by one they bowed, each in the fashion of whatever hall had first taught them to move. When the last lantern was doused and the hearth drew its breath low, I traced the star once more with my boot heel so tomorrowâ€™s feet would find their way. The room kept the lesson after we had gone; the chalk held the tune.
