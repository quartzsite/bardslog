My lute is cracked along its rim, but my spirit has never been more whole. After the scuffle at the Smoky Hearth I spent the night staring at the splinter in the instrument's soundboard and thinking of the look in the dockhand’s eyes when I parried his blade. I felt something I had not felt since my youth: purpose.

This morning I traded the last of my coin for a wooden waster at a smith’s stall. It is a simple length of oak cut to resemble a sword, weighted and balanced but blunt. It is heavier than the lute, but it sits in my hand with the promise of possibilities. As I left the city gates, the dawn fog over the river seemed to part as if making way.

For so long I believed that songs were my only gift. Now I see that learning to fight is not a betrayal of who I am but an extension of it. The old songs speak of heroes who were poets and warriors both. If I am to survive and to be heard, I must learn to let my body tell its own stories. Today I begin again, born not of blood but of will.
