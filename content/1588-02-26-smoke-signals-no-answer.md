We carried coals to the cliff and braided green fronds into the fire until it breathed a long pale line. Rell watched the wind; Garran fed the pit the way you feed a shy guest. Osric kept count—seven plumes before noon, seven after—bookkeeping against silence.

The horizon read nothing back. No answering smear of smoke. No square of sail. Even the gulls ignored our plea and haggled over a crab below.

We tried a higher stack, then a lower one. We tried damp wood for dark signal, drift for light. Wind trimmed our letters into a script no captain would know. When dusk came, we banked the ember and listened to a sea that did not speak.

At dawn we dragged the stones into a circle and set a staff in the middle. The shadow crept. East declared itself without a ship’s help. If the world would not come, it had given us a direction.
