I stayed in Bonona after training, seeking warmth in the tavern of the Crescent Moon.  \n
There, over cheap wine and dice, I overheard members of Master Maros's guild speaking in low voices.  \n
They were not talking of fencing but of politics.  \n
One boasted that the guild had acted "for the good of Bonona" by poisoning Master Merryen.  \n
According to them, Merryen had been on his way to meet a duke who ruled a small, semiâ€‘independent territory within the fragmented structure of the Empire.  \n
The duke, they said, had plans to march on the capital where Bonona sits and bring it under his banner.  \n
If Merryen had brokered an alliance, the duke might have had the skill and knowledge to succeed.  \n
So they slipped venom into Merryen's cup and left him to die rather than risk the Empire's armies at their gate.  \n
My stomach turned.  \n
The honourable guild that saluted at his funeral had also been his murderers.  \n
I thought of the hermit's teachings and of Master Merryen's generosity; to learn that he had been betrayed by his own was a cut deeper than any blade.  \n
It struck me then that I was walking a thin line between art and politics.  \n
Bonona thrived within the Empire's shadow, but its masters would kill to keep it free.  \n
Strasbourg's guilds swore loyalty to the Emperor, yet they had taught me to fight.  \n
All the factions, the dukes and cities, seemed ready to turn steel against each other.  \n
If I stayed, I would be drawn into their web.  \n
That night I made a decision.  \n
I would leave Bonona in secret, taking passage on a ship bound west.  \n
I would disguise myself as a common sailor and, if need be, stow away below deck.  \n
Where that ship would toss me I did not yet know, but I sensed my path would lead me toward the Distant Isles and to a master named Carlen Rowen of Lynden.  \n
The next chapter of my journey would be written far from the eyes of Bonona's guilds.  \n
