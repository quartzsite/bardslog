For days Master Merryen had been growing pale. At first we thought it was the strain of training us all, but soon his coughs echoed between the pillars of the hall and his hand trembled when he lifted the waster.  

He laughed it off, making jokes about too much study and not enough wine, but there were moments when I saw sweat bead on his brow during a simple demonstration. His pupils whispered behind his back, worrying yet not daring to speak.  

I had never imagined that a man who moved with such grace could be fallible, yet each of us is made of flesh. It was not the thrusts of a rival or the cut of a blade that threatened him, but an unseen fever that none of us could parry.  

In the evenings I sat by the window of the Fechtschule and played songs about long winters and fading fires. My fingers were calloused from both strings and steel. I tried to believe that the tunes would chase away whatever ailment clung to him.  

Unease settled over us like November mist. I began to understand that there are battles we cannot fight for those we love, only watch and wait. Even masters are mortal.
