We learned the inlet like a page. Three long sets, one short, then still water that holds its breath. We said the count out loud until the mouth of the reef answered to our timing. Garran logged each surge with a notch. Rell called when to push and when to wait. The quartermaster cut no rope until the numbers were sure.

We kept a coal in a clay cup under sand so the next fire would not steal our morning. Meat hung above the smoke. Salt dried on palm leaves. A larder began where there had been only hunger.

On the headland we stacked wet driftwood for a black column and dry for a white. Smoke climbed. No craft turned. The sea kept its counsel, and we kept our count.

At dusk I scratched a fixed star onto a board and pegged a line through the center. In the lagoon the board settled true when the raft faced the same star. A toy, then a tool, then a thought we could not put down â€” a boat that points east if we trust what does not move.

We did not leave the reef today. We learned how to leave tomorrow.
