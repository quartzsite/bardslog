Merryen holds court with Octish traders in the tannery loft. He calls it a fencing society; I hear the rustle of paper more than steel. Their talk is wind on stone. Mine is Silence on ink. I keep your sigil covered and speak when strings demand it.\nIf the fifth song is to be played, it will be by accident—like a chord struck by a drunk who somehow finds harmony. My cure is to keep the lute in its case.\n—FB",

He measures courtyards with his eyes as if they were parade grounds and says the north wind will bring friends who knot their maps instead of drawing them. He will not speak the name of Rowen’s city without spitting first; Lynden lives rent-free in his jaw. I nod, take notes that look like scales for a sad song, and keep my counsel.\n\nThe Free Cities talk louder than they listen. In the guild we have not forgotten our fifth. We name it only as a folded page. We play Wind, Stone, Flame, and Water in the open, but the last we keep under the bridge of the lute, where the sound is felt and not heard. I can hear its tread in the courtyards—counting, counting. You taught me to hear it and then to put it away.\n\nOnce a trader offered silver for the whole manuscript-in-progress. I closed the cover and pushed it back to him. “You can have a copy,” I said, “if you leave a copy behind.” He left a page he did not understand and took away a page he never will. The bargain holds: knowledge breeds only when it travels both ways.\n\nI confess a weariness. Every tool finds a hand; even wrapped in cloth, a blade teaches the fingers by shape alone. The fifth is a stair and fools will climb it just to see who salutes. So I write the steps into chords and waystones, and I sing them wrong when company gathers. Let the wrong ears remember the wrong tune.\n\nIf you would have me leave this city, write a single dot under the third line of your reply. If not, I will linger and practice the long measure at dusk until the drilling drowns it. The stone by the river hums at the turn of tide. Either the gods are listening, or men are.\n\nYour student in poor spirits and plain ink,\nFB",

      "body": "To be opened by the Boatswain, or, failing him, by any man who still knows the taste of tar and wind,\n\nAboard the Everspring,\nthree leagues west of the Iron Shoals\n\nBosun—\n\nYou may think me drunk on sour rum or sunstroke, but I’ll swear this by the mizzenmast’s own creak: the stowaway was a blessing. Found him coiled among the sailcloth like a cat, thin as rope’s end and twice as frayed, clutching a lute as if it were scripture. I’d have had him whipped to the gunwale for hiding, but the tide was foul and the wind colder than law, so I kept him on to swab the deck. By second bell he’d made the planks shine, and by sunset he’d taught half the crew how to step to measure.\n\nCalls himself Faelar Brighton, a bard by trade, though I’ve seen few bards who keep such measure in the midst of a gale. When we were becalmed near the Shoals, he drew a star on the deck between main and mizzen—five points, broad and perfect—and began to teach the crew footwork as though he’d a school instead of a ship. I meant to have it holystoned off, but the men fought better for it, so I let it be.\n\nCome next dawn, raiders rose out of the fog—black sails, no colours shown. Faelar took the quarterdeck without leave and called the crew to measure. They fought not as killers but as craftsmen. The star on the deck became a compass, and the Everspring herself sang through the smoke.\n\nThat night, when all was done and our dead counted, he and I shared what little rum remained. He spoke of guilds where art and mercy were brothered, and I—fool that I am—believed we might found one of our own. “A seaward chapter,” I told him, “to teach measure before men learn blood.” He smiled and said the sea was too wide for a single compass, but his eyes said hope otherwise.\n\nNow the wind’s turned. Rations thin, casks lighter than they should be, and the hands whisper mutiny. They say I spare faith for a bard and none for sailors. They forget that the Everspring’s name was meant as a promise—new beginnings for us all. But promises rot faster than rope in damp hold.\n\nIf this reaches you, Bosun, tell Faelar that Captain Vess forgave the sea before it took him. Tell him the measure holds, even when the ship heels. Tell him to build the Guild on land, where no tide can claim it.\n\nI can hear them now on the ladderway. The mizzen groans like a soul that knows its end.\n\n— Captain T. Vess\nMaster and Commander, Everspring\nWestward Trader Line, in faith to no crown but the compass",
