The court preachers call it a miracle of the One. The masons call it settling. I call it a compass.\nPatrols have doubled along the quay roads, but their eyes look past the Free Cities and their Oct banners, as if tin boats could not carry fire. The edicts are sermons about stone; the enemy in the east is wind, they say, and wind dies on rock. I have swept enough steps to know wind brings dust, and dust becomes mortar if you wet it.\nRecommendation: stop counting shadows; start counting printers.\n— Scribe Janna, Basilith Watch",

The Wind Emissary placed a length of silk so thin it made the stars ripple. They spoke of tariffs and maps while meaning soldiers and shrines. Stone said: hold. Wind said: move.

Almost is sometimes a victory.\nNotes:\n— Stone ignores the western nuisance (their phrase) of Free Cities and Oct banners; their eyes lean east like their shadows.\n— Wind names the western pact pagan and small; their riders know the river paths better than we guessed.\n— Both courts deny a fifth god; both fear the word for it. The Wind calls it Sandstorm. Stone calls it Siege. The bard wrote only a rest.\nAdjourned at moonrise. The cube and the silk were exchanged: a copy for a copy.

I set him instead to ringing the small bell until his hand remembers other measures.\nThe city wants its steps in straight lines. Merryen and his kind use ink like trumpets; I use it like water on a hot blade—hiss, cool, temper. The guild’s rule of reciprocity is a mercy disguised as a nuisance; the Empire will call it sedition because sedition is easier to spell than mercy.\nAs for the Fifth, I have written it in rests and given it to a boy who cannot yet read but knows when a room changes breath. If this is heresy, then I prefer this heresy to any tidy obedience.\nWhen I was young I believed Stone was God’s voice; now I know God has many registers. Let us keep the loud ones for feast days and the quiet for saving lives.\nI commend my untruths to your judgment.\n— Prior Hubert",

He named three dukes he’d served and none he’d loved. When asked what turned him from pay, he said a stowaway with a lute drew a five-pointed star on a ship’s deck and made tired hands move like craftsmen. \"I thought then,\" he said, \"that measure could unteach killing.\"\nHe described the Fifth as you would describe a winter that lives under the floorboards. \"It is not a note,\" he said, \"but the hush that keeps notes from becoming orders. You can hear it when boys start whispering instead of shouting.\"\nOf Merryen he spoke without hatred. \"He wants a parade that does not end,\" Waryn said. \"Parades end in walls. The road has no walls.\"\nHe told of a levy drilled to a hymn until the hymn grew teeth. He stepped a simple turn on the hall’s stones and showed how a man can give a stranger his life back with a palm instead of a point. Two journeymen tried the turn and failed twice, then laughed when they caught it. The room loosened.\nAsked what he wanted in payment for his testimony, he said: \"Paper for the printer’s boy, and a rope for the canal men that won’t rot, and a ribbon for my Edith.

There, at dusk, four hands set seals to a page that was more promise than law.\nLady Alisoun of Irenne came in plain wool, her ring turned inward. Prior Hubert brought a parchment whose back was a child’s practice hand. Serjeant Waryn leaned on the rail and counted the boards between lanterns. Faelar Brighton tuned his lute until the bridge itself seemed to listen.\nThe Covenant spoke first of copies: that any man or woman may take a page of the Art if they leave a page of equal weight—witness, correction, map, song, mercy done and written down. Second, it named the Four Voices as public: Wind for teaching, Water for trade, Stone for record, Flame for warning. Third, it bound the Fifth—Silence—to margins and music, to be taught as rest and never as march.\nAlisoun said — we will mint neighbors, not soldiers. Hubert added — where we cannot write safely, we will breathe wisely. Waryn swore a soldier’s oath in reverse — he would step first for life. Faelar wrote a bar of music on the bottom edge, a measure that breaks if you try to march to it.\nA boy in the shadows — Perkin — held the ink. A canal man tied the covenant to the under-beam with tarred thread. Someone, years from now, will find it when the river forgets itself again.\nThere were no trumpets. The city did not change at once. But a press pulled smoother that night; a monk slept without hearing drums; a veteran woke with both hands open.\nAt the end Faelar said softly — a copy for a copy; and Alisoun answered — and a rest for a life.\n— Witnessed at the Red Bridge, Bonona",

He measures courtyards with his eyes as if they were parade grounds and says the north wind will bring friends who knot their maps instead of drawing them. He will not speak the name of Rowen’s city without spitting first; Lynden lives rent-free in his jaw. I nod, take notes that look like scales for a sad song, and keep my counsel.\n\nThe Free Cities talk louder than they listen. In the guild we have not forgotten our fifth. We name it only as a folded page. We play Wind, Stone, Flame, and Water in the open, but the last we keep under the bridge of the lute, where the sound is felt and not heard. I can hear its tread in the courtyards—counting, counting. You taught me to hear it and then to put it away.\n\nOnce a trader offered silver for the whole manuscript-in-progress. I closed the cover and pushed it back to him. 'You can have a copy,' I said, 'if you leave a copy behind.' He left a page he did not understand and took away a page he never will. The bargain holds: knowledge breeds only when it travels both ways.\n\nI confess a weariness. Every tool finds a hand; even wrapped in cloth, a blade teaches the fingers by shape alone. The fifth is a stair and fools will climb it just to see who salutes. So I write the steps into chords and waystones, and I sing them wrong when company gathers. Let the wrong ears remember the wrong tune.\n\nIf you would have me leave this city, write a single dot under the third line of your reply. If not, I will linger and practice the long measure at dusk until the drilling drowns it. The stone by the river hums at the turn of tide. Either the gods are listening, or men are.\n\nYour student in poor spirits and plain ink,\nFB",

      "body": "To be opened by the Boatswain, or, failing him, by any man who still knows the taste of tar and wind,\n\nAboard the Everspring,\nthree leagues west of the Iron Shoals\n\nBosun—\n\nYou may think me drunk on sour rum or sunstroke, but I’ll swear this by the mizzenmast’s own creak: the stowaway was a blessing. Found him coiled among the sailcloth like a cat, thin as rope’s end and twice as frayed, clutching a lute as if it were scripture. I’d have had him whipped to the gunwale for hiding, but the tide was foul and the wind colder than law, so I kept him on to swab the deck. By second bell he’d made the planks shine, and by sunset he’d taught half the crew how to step to measure.\n\nCalls himself Faelar Brighton, a bard by trade, though I’ve seen few bards who keep such measure in the midst of a gale. When we were becalmed near the Shoals, he drew a star on the deck between main and mizzen—five points, broad and perfect—and began to teach the crew footwork as though he’d a school instead of a ship. I meant to have it holystoned off, but the men fought better for it, so I let it be.\n\nCome next dawn, raiders rose out of the fog—black sails, no colours shown. Faelar took the quarterdeck without leave and called the crew to measure. They fought not as killers but as craftsmen. The star on the deck became a compass, and the Everspring herself sang through the smoke.\n\nThat night, when all was done and our dead counted, he and I shared what little rum remained. He spoke of guilds where art and mercy were brothered, and I—fool that I am—believed we might found one of our own. 'A seaward chapter,' I told him, 'to teach measure before men learn blood.' He smiled and said the sea was too wide for a single compass, but his eyes said hope otherwise.\n\nNow the wind’s turned. Rations thin, casks lighter than they should be, and the hands whisper mutiny. They say I spare faith for a bard and none for sailors. They forget that the Everspring’s name was meant as a promise—new beginnings for us all. But promises rot faster than rope in damp hold.\n\nIf this reaches you, Bosun, tell Faelar that Captain Vess forgave the sea before it took him. Tell him the measure holds, even when the ship heels. Tell him to build the Guild on land, where no tide can claim it.\n\nI can hear them now on the ladderway. The mizzen groans like a soul that knows its end.\n\n— Captain T. Vess\nMaster and Commander, Everspring\nWestward Trader Line, in faith to no crown but the compass",
